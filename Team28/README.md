Overview:



Features:

- KMeans Clustering and WordCloud:

- Rule-based learning:

- Deployment : The project also includes steamlit_app.py, a POC for deploying the analytical elements in the Jupyter Notebook. streamlit_app.py provides 2 features - 
	1. It allows the user to upload a csv file and specify the number of clusters that they want to analyze. The script generates clusters using KMeans Clustering and displays a wordcloud for each cluster.
	2. It provides a POC of a chatbot to interact with. It provides a allows the user to provide a dataset of focus groups. The 

Run the following command in Anaconda Prompt to deploy the streamlit app on localhost:
