We\\'re just going to wait for a couple more people to join.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nGood afternoon.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n(silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:03:43]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n(silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:03:43].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi [Administrator 00:03:43], we\\'re just waiting for everyone to join.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n(silence)\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSo, Moderator 1, I just sent the link to one other parent who will be joining us. So, she\\'ll probably come on in the next minute or two.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Great. I think that Moderator 2 is joining also, so...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n(silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:05:22]\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi Moderator 2.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:05:27].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you everyone for joining, it looks like we\\'re all on. So, thanks so much for taking out some time to have this focus group today. So, the purpose of the group is really just to get some more information [crosstalk 00:05:50] about different family\\'s experiences during COVID-19 as it relates to technology. I know you all filled out our crisis survey. So, this is really meant to go more in depth and get some qualitative information.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo, I was thinking we could start by just going around and introducing ourselves. Maybe say the ages of your kids, and then if you would like to share a recommendation of a TV show or a movie that you have really enjoyed over the pandemic, feel free to do that as well.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo, I can start. My name is Moderator 1. I\\'m the clinical training and assessment manager for the Harlem team of HDN. And one show that I started watching recently, which I\\'m a little bit late to is Ozark. It\\'s a little bit intense, so I know that\\'s not what everyone is in the mood for these days, but it is excellent and I highly recommend it. Moderator 2?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Moderator 2. I\\'m the project director for Healthy Brain Network. I\\'m joining today\\'s session. A good show... My daughter is 13, tomorrow actually [crosstalk 00:07:15] and then I have two boys [inaudible 00:07:16] and seven. I don\\'t know, I started watching this show called Good Girls a while ago, and there\\'s a new season on and it\\'s airing each week. It\\'s about three seemingly innocent suburban housewives who somehow get involved in money laundering and bank heists.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI second that recommendation. It\\'s a great show. Parent 5, you want to go next?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nSure. Hi. My name is Parent 5. I have three kids, 17, 13 and nine, all boys. A good show that I started watching over the pandemic is called The Repair Shop, and if you want to see a show about nothing except things being fixed, it\\'s a good show.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you. Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi everyone. My name is Parent 1, I have two boys, a 8-year-old and almost 3-year-old. I think the most recent show that I personally watched with no children around was Schitt\\'s Creek, which was amazing and helped me get through all these difficult times lately. I was a little bit late to the party, I started watching it maybe a month or two ago, but I could not stop. Even if the work hours were late, I had to make sure I\\'ll catch an episode before I go sleep. With the kids, well with the older kid, I think a few months ago we watched Floor Is Lava on Netflix, which was fun to watch as a family. Besides that, I think my son watches lots of Marvel type things with my husband, which I don\\'t participate in.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 1. Parent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi everybody. My name is Parent 3 and I have an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. We don\\'t watch television together at all, it\\'s just for me. They Roblox with their friends and that\\'s all they do. I\\'ve watched a couple of foreign things my friends have recommended, but I\\'d love to recommend a series, it\\'s long but it\\'s amazing, it\\'s called Orphan Black. It\\'s been around for a little while, it\\'s produced by the BBC. It\\'s sci-if and it\\'s about cloning. It has five seasons. It\\'s a real deep dive, but it\\'s incredible and now it just won an Emmy. So I\\'ll say Orphan Black, it\\'s really great.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. I\\'ve heard good things about it, but [inaudible 00:10:25].\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, you won\\'t be-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you. Parent 4?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Parent 4, I have a 15-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old son. One of the shows I recently just got into was Big Sky, it just started, it\\'s a few episodes in. It\\'s a new show, so far so good.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. And then, Parent 2.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI think you\\'re on mute. Are you there Parent 2?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, I think I saw you come on before, maybe you stepped away for a minute. You\\'re on mute. Oh, there you are.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOh, me?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOh, I\\'m sorry. I lost connection, I couldn\\'t hear anyone. My name is Parent 2, I have a 17-year-old, he\\'s actually my step-son and I have two 10-year-old boys and I have a 3-year-old girl. What shows have I been watching... I\\'ve been watching a few things, but most recently I\\'ve been binge watching 9-1-1, it\\'s a drama about 911 operators and I guess the LAFD and LAPD, and all the things that they go through. I can\\'t say why would I want to watch that, I don\\'t know, especially during these times. I have no idea why I watch, but it\\'s just interesting and I learn things from watching it. But yeah, and then with my children, they\\'ve been watching Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I don\\'t know if anyone\\'s familiar with that-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh, of course, that\\'s why I bet people are still watching that.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:12:42] series. Yes. My 10-year-olds, they love it. A certain time of the day, we all as a family will watch it. We actually finished that and now they\\'re watching a show called Fresh Off the Boat. It\\'s a newer show on ABC. Yeah, so those are the things we\\'ve been watching.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 2.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, one thing that we really want to emphasize is that we know that everyone is having some very common experiences between each other, and then also everyone is having their own unique experiences. So we really just want to hear from everyone and if somebody thinks one way about something, we really encourage you to speak up about your own individual experience. We thought that a good way to start might be if everyone could just grab a paper and pencil and try to write down three positive ways that technology has impacted you since the start of the pandemic, and two or three negative ways that technology has impacted you since the start of the pandemic. And then we\\'ll talk about it.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nUs personally, or about our children?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nBoth, but more focused on your children I guess.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n(silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI\\'m going to give you another minute, but as you\\'re writing, I also want you to then circle whichever group has had a bigger impact. So, has the positive aspects of technology had a bigger impact on your kids, or has the negative aspects of technology had a bigger impact on your kids?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n(silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou can just look up when you\\'re done.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, by a show of hands, who felt that the positive impacts have had a bigger overall effect? Anyone?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, and then, who felt that the negative impacts have been more clear. Okay, I\\'m seeing all the hands... Parent 2, I can\\'t see what you\\'re doing. Did you feel like the positive or negative effects of technology have had a bigger impact?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOh, I thought you seen my hand, I know it was an option to raise your hand, but the negative.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, okay. So it seems like this whole group feels that way, so let\\'s delve a little bit deeper into that over the next hour or so and hear some details. So Moderator 2, do you want to start with the...\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSure. So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes. You can say whether it was beneficial, they didn\\'t use it at all, you had concerns, it was a problem.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYou said before the pandemic?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah, prior.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nPrior, okay so are you calling on anyone specific or can we just answer?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYou can just go ahead, start us off.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOh okay. Well, they didn\\'t use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn\\'t have to go on as much. I mean, that\\'s what it was.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don\\'t know if that\\'s the right word, into Docs, but it wasn\\'t a huge amount. It wasn\\'t doing research, it wasn\\'t hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn\\'t have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn\\'t that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn\\'t even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn\\'t know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo, so far, pretty limited use of technology before, for school purposes. Parent 1 and Parent 4?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it\\'s just like a free-for-all. I mean, they\\'re in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they\\'re doing all day. I just know that they\\'re doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they\\'re on electronics the entire day.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, we\\'ll definitely get more into that. Parent 1, was...\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father\\'s house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that\\'s a trip in itself.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThere was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn\\'t seem like enough, it didn\\'t seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don\\'t know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot. And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to earn and if you didn\\'t do well then you don\\'t get to play. So it was a tool we could use as incentive during the week. So now that\\'s all out the window, it\\'s all available right there all day long. And getting him away from the computer now is a project in itself every day.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 1.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can say for my eight-year-old, because again, we went from not really knowing how to use a computer or how to type, to transition really smoothly, I mean if you can call that a benefit, we transitioned really quickly. He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I\\'m sorry, can you repeat the question?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHow the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it\\'s beneficial or problematic.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nRight, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there\\'s some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I\\'m sure it is a good thing, it\\'s just, like I said, it\\'s just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can\\'t block YouTube because it\\'ll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBut YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can\\'t even begin, it\\'s just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here\\'s YouTube, it\\'s just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can\\'t just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that\\'s not beneficial for kids, that\\'s been problematic, to say the least.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 1, so I saw a few of you agreeing with Parent 1 on some of those points. Anyone else have anything to add about-\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI can go.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, thanks Parent 5.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nSo for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn\\'t used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn\\'t want to be on.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThe schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it\\'s hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn\\'t a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it\\'s like this black hole that sucks you in.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, so it sounds like it really messed with... There was probably a lot of factors that mess with the structure, but the technology really contributed to that. [00:29:36], Parent 4, Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it\\'s all very old and kind of fragile and I\\'m like, they\\'re going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We\\'re self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\"\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora\\'s box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with the DOE, I was on the phone with a parent coordinator, I was calling the principal, like, \"How can I block YouTube without...\" I was putting timer things, it was driving me crazy, and it was downhill from there. I finally figured out my son, by banging on it so much he\\'s actually broken the screen so whatever controls I put in, he could bang on it and it would just do whatever he wanted. A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Yeah, the addiction sunk in over those first five months of lockdown of screens and YouTube and just that misery sucking.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4, what is your experience been like with using technology for education?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nLike I said, both my kids are on it all day. They\\'re fully remote, both of them. Neither one of them has a full schedule so I hear my son... Because my desk is right next to his room, and I\\'m hearing him at like 10:00 in the morning, profanities on a game with his friend. And I\\'m like, I don\\'t understand, it\\'s a school day. Well, they don\\'t have school, it\\'s in between a break. So it\\'s definitely made our day... Especially since I\\'m working right next to him, very difficult to try and do my job and be next to him. But it\\'s their lives, they\\'re in their rooms, if it\\'s not school then it\\'s playing games. My son plays a lot of games with his friends, my daughter doesn\\'t but then she\\'ll be on the YouTube also a lot, TickTock, whatever, and I kind of don\\'t see them a lot during the day. Thankfully they do okay so I don\\'t ask... I used to be a more involved and now I\\'m not really involved. Now it\\'s a free for all.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting, now that they\\'re home that you feel less involved than before.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah, I don\\'t feel like there\\'s even much to be involved. They don\\'t have much, especially my middle Schooler, has nothing to do so there isn\\'t even much for me to ask him.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nDo any of you think that you\\'ll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAbsolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I\\'m having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn\\'t say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what\\'s going to happen next year.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut after everything shut down I didn\\'t have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn\\'t send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they\\'re back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you\\'re having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that\\'s my experience.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 2, so yeah I\\'d like to hear from other people what challenges you anticipate for returning to school.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nFor me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I\\'m sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn\\'t been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they\\'re moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He\\'s looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it\\'s interesting because sometimes...\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nExhibit A.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd my high schooler, I think it\\'s interesting because even if he\\'s the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You\\'re going to keep going?\" And he\\'s like, \"Yeah, I\\'m going to go.\" And I\\'m like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don\\'t anticipate any issues. He\\'s graduating, I think that\\'s also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that, he I think wants that connection with people. So when he supposed to go, which is kind of like one day a week, maybe sometimes two days a week, they have this weird schedule that I still can\\'t figure out, he\\'s been going, he goes. So with my kids, they have bought into going back to school.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI could go next.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy son has been on a 2-3 day week model since January. Before that it was 1-2 days a week I think. But between all the quarantines and the school closures because of those two case rules that they had we were in quarantine all the time until... Hopefully going forward it will be better, but we were in school barely, mostly all remote because of all that. But we\\'ve gone a few times for sure. My son, he\\'s on the spectrum so he has all these social/emotional issues that usually prevent him from being able to get along with children. All prior to the school year... We did start a new school this year, so in September we went to a new school that we\\'ve attended this year, which was a group of 7-8 kids, when he was in person because of the cohorts. So maybe that has to do with an overall positive experience for him on the days that he did go in person, compared to the prior years when he was one of 32 with all these issues that he had that we didn\\'t even address until this year.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAnd as a matter fact we just actually got placed in the NES program so hopefully next year he will... Even though it was a difficult decision to make because we just started a new school this year, new school next year, but I understand it would benefit him and sort of tailored to the exact issues that he has. But in terms of him going back in person, it has been an overall positive experience, he is not protesting or anything. He was able to even make some friends even though they\\'re social distancing with masks on and everything. So I was surprised and happy about that.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHopefully that will continue, but again, he will go to this program in September, he\\'ll be in a smaller class size. Because I think the 32 kids that we\\'ve always had was overwhelming for him and he couldn\\'t get along with anyone and it was just daily calls from school and nobody really ever addressed the issues that he had. It was always just like, he\\'s that kid, type of thing. All the tears that were cried by me. So yeah, so I think... He actually even said the other day, \"Oh yes, I\\'m going...\" Because I remind him advance to prepare him that tomorrow is in person. He said, \"Oh yeah, I\\'ll have something else to do than to play Roblox.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nExactly. Yeah, it sounds like the transition back may be different because he\\'s going to be in a different setting that\\'s hopefully more geared towards him.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nExactly. So I think this is actually one of the silver linings for me with the pandemic, is kids that have issues, sort of like some of our children, when there\\'s a big class size and one teacher and all that, they may not have a good experience I may not want to go back there. But so far, in our case, I think due to the smaller class size, due to having a little more, I guess, personal attention from the teacher who is able to expand herself for the seven kids, it was overall good. It was actually better than the years before.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nInteresting. So I\\'m just going to move on to a different question before we focus more on gaming. So as we\\'re going back to school I\\'m just curious to hear from people, are there any aspects of the changes in the use of technology that you would like to see continue as we go back? Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you\\'re really hoping would end as we go back?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSorry, I was...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, Parent 3, and then Parent 4, yeah.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThe Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she\\'ll never raise her hand and she\\'ll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It\\'s going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that\\'s an interesting point. So, that\\'s something that would be a nice aspect to continue because it seems like it\\'s drawn her out of her shell. Parent 4, did you want to say something you\\'d like to see continue or end?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It\\'s probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he\\'s doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that\\'s nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it\\'s at least Something. So, that\\'s nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can just-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that\\'s been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven\\'t been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I\\'m very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn\\'t even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There\\'s a demand and there\\'s a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that\\'s great. Parent 2, anything to add before we move into the next portion?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThe only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou feel like that\\'s improved?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren\\'t doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn\\'t really like it so I\\'m kind of glad...\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI mean, now that they\\'re going to school five days a week they don\\'t need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use it, but I didn\\'t really like it, it wasn\\'t intuitive and I wasn\\'t able to view the assignments, both of their assignments to make sure that they did it. And then some things they were able to do online, but somethings they had to print out, so it was kind of all over the place. So yeah, the only thing I would appreciate that they continue doing is using it as a way to communicate with the parents, that\\'s all.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, and Parent 5, we\\'ll definitely add your comment to our notes, thank you. Okay, let\\'s, for the last 10 or 15 minutes, just move into talking a little bit about gaming specifically. I\\'d like to hear from you guys, what was your child\\'s gaming use before the pandemic, did you see it as beneficial? Did you have concerns before? And then, how has that gaming use changed since the pandemic started, any benefits? Do you have concerns or problems? So I open it up to whoever wants to start.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI can go.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy daughter never did gaming before. I mean, years ago she did Minecraft, but not anything recently. She does other stuff online and is on there a lot, but as far as gaming, no. My son, the only positive thing I guess about it is we don\\'t fight about it as much. I used to have to... It\\'s not necessarily positive, it\\'s kind of contradictory, but I don\\'t even tell him to get off anymore. It used to be a fight because I used to have to tell him to get off, now we don\\'t... So the fighting has actually gone down. The flip side of that is he\\'s just on so much more. The language has got worse on the game and I\\'m constantly having to stop it. But he also has gotten a little closer with some of his friends that he can\\'t see anymore because they\\'re online talking. And the moms and I will say, \"Did you hear they did this,\" if there\\'s a problem. I mean, he\\'s definitely playing more, but he played a lot beforehand too, not like this.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, but it\\'s an interesting point you made about it not being a point of contention anymore because you\\'re just-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt was at the beginning. At the beginning of all of this, it was. Then after I realized that there\\'s nothing else for him to do... I mean, at one point he had a broken ankle so he couldn\\'t even play his sports, even take a walk. Then I\\'m like, what am I going to... Unless I\\'m prepared to sit there and entertain him or teach him myself, which I can\\'t when I\\'m working, I have no choice.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can go next.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAs I mentioned, we did not play a lot, certainly some of these video that involve multiplayer or whatever, when they have to chat with each other and they can do it together. We didn\\'t have any exposure to that. I can\\'t again, he was seven years old, he\\'s eight now, so maybe it was just a little early. But this year it just blossomed, if it\\'s the right word, he\\'s playing a lot. I think some of it, again, may be my fault because it\\'s a good babysitter. If you\\'re trying to get through your work, we all have jobs, demanding jobs, it\\'s easier to... instead of just standing there trying to control his gaming, you\\'re just, \"Okay, he\\'s busy and I\\'m going to get my work done.\" So I think it lasted for a while and I think I just kind of gave into that convenience. Just because it truly... I also had to get my job done. Do you know?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo I think I gave into that and I just kind of let it go until I realized it\\'s 12:00 and just out of control, so I decided to regain some control successfully. I was able to separate his computer from gaming computer. So that works out, so far so good. I limited it, so he plays a little bit less. But in terms of positive, I also would echo what Parent 4 said, that he was able to connect a little bit more with his friends. And again, as I mentioned, he does have issues with social life, he has trouble making friends and doesn\\'t use appropriate language with friends so sometimes they don\\'t want to be friends with him, those type of things. While they play all these video games and they\\'re pursuing the same goal, whatever that goal is in a game, and he was able to connect with them and speak to them, something we may not even have had, had we not been sitting at home without being able to [inaudible 00:53:56].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt sounds like it\\'s going through different waves for you sort of.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Anyone else?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWell, for me the gaming, I was able to control it a little more before the pandemic, but now I noticed that it\\'s starting getting out of control. Once I noticed that they were sneaking to go on Roblox and YouTube instead of doing their work. And then once I seen that it was... I would say it was just affecting their attention and they weren\\'t focused so when I would punish them and say, \"Well, now you can\\'t go on Roblox,\" they would get really upset, they would cry. It was like it was the end of the world for them. I think at one point I changed their password so they can\\'t logon unless I log on for them.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut they learned that if they never log off, if they were to just leave it, they can just open the page back up. So I didn\\'t realize that that was happening. I\\'m like, \"Wait, how are you on Roblox? Oh, you never logged off.\" So on Sunday evenings I have to make sure I\\'ve logged them off. Because I would let them play after they did their work, but they weren\\'t really doing that great in school so then I just said no more Roblox during the week. Yeah, so I try to control it but it\\'s still hard because then they still have YouTube that they watch and it\\'s just...\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut I guess one positive outcome is the fact that they were communicating with their friends, with their cousin who lives far away, or whatever. They have a better social life. Because before they wouldn\\'t talk to anybody but now they communicate, they keep in touch. But now it\\'s just regaining the control back and getting them to understand that there\\'s a time and place for everything and you shouldn\\'t allow these things to consume your time. It\\'s frustrating for me after a while. I\\'m like, \"Wait, you guys have been on the computer all day. No. You guys, no, it\\'s time to give this a break.\" Then they\\'ll get upset and it\\'s an argument. So yeah, that\\'s it for me.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Okay, thank you Parent 2. Yeah, Parent 5?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI can say that initially with my high schooler I felt like he got almost depressed. He was a very good academic student, he had some social issues but academically he was doing very well, a 90-something average. And he started failing all his classes. He wasn\\'t attending, he wasn\\'t going, he was in bed all day. I would talk to him and I was the one that said, \"Well, why don\\'t you try maybe connecting with your friends?\" Because he didn\\'t have social media so I was like, \"Why don\\'t you try connecting with your friends? Maybe play a game with them or send them a message and see how they\\'re doing.\" That helped, to connect, but then the connection is all now on this...\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI don\\'t even know, he plays Minecraft I think. Then it was like two hours, and four hours, and six hours, and eight hours, and 10 hours, and 12 hours, 14 hours, or 16 hours. It was crazy. And so much so, I took the boys to Florida, we drove to Florida over the summer to see my brother and even at my brother\\'s house, his cousins were here there and he had the pool and stuff like that and he would spend 10 hours, 12 hours, 14 hours a day stuck in a room. And he would get upset if I would say, \"No, we\\'re going to go out. We\\'re going to take a walk. Or let\\'s go swimming.\" It just became... And still it\\'s very hard to get a handle on it at 17. It\\'s very, very hard, I feel, to get a handle on it. I\\'m like, \"You need to go to bed.\" Even last night, it was 1:00 in the morning and I go, \"You\\'re going to go to school tomorrow, you should go to bed.\"\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd it\\'s like, am I going to rip his laptop out of his room and we\\'re going to fight? I don\\'t want to do that, I tried to do that a couple of times and it just wasn\\'t worth it to me. I just say to him, \"Look, you are becoming a young adult. You\\'re going to have to make decisions for yourself. This isn\\'t life, you can\\'t game for 16 hours a day.\" So with my younger ones it also feels out of control, but it feels the most out of control with my 17-year-old because he\\'s like six feet tall, he has\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, and I can imagine it\\'s harder to regulate it with him and to have-\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah, when he was younger I used to look at his phone and monitor and all this kind of stuff but now it\\'s very hard to know the line and it\\'s very hard to... He had social issues very similar to what Parent 1 was talking about. And now he has these friends, these online friends. He\\'s never had a crew and now he has this crew and they all want to play with him and, \"Matthew, are you coming on?\" So yeah, it\\'s\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, all right, thank you Parent 5. We\\'re coming to the end, we have a few minutes left, Parent 3 I\\'d like to hear your experiences, both before and during with gaming, benefits, concerns. And then we\\'ll probably end.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay, with gaming, very similar to everybody here. It was a little bit of a problem the summer before. We go up north, up to Maine where my mom grew up, and if you turn on the TV the first two channels are French. So I said, \"Sorry, the TV speaks French.\" And that\\'s it, it\\'s never gone further than that. So I\\'ve managed up to this point to keep them off. We\\'ve got an old VCR that plays movies. I\\'ve been able to keep them off tablets for all this time. And now, with the pandemic, I had a concussion last year and it was like, all bets are off. They were just on devices and they were using the phone, they were FaceTime-ing their friends on the devices.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd now we\\'re at the point where my son says all the friends have moved away, we\\'re in downtown Manhattan and all the friends have left so my son says, \"I have no friends.\" Calls up a friend and then he\\'ll be on for three hours, or four, five, or six, seven. My daughter has made an alternative account, I just found out, and she\\'s trolling on Roblox. She\\'s 11, [inaudible 01:01:54], people who are dating, and she will troll them. So that\\'s something to be proud of for me. It\\'s just a nightmare. So now I\\'m looking at software that I can block the whole thing down. I\\'ve put a padlock on where our desktop computer is, on the door, and she\\'ll hide the lock. I\\'m like, \"Where is the padlock?\" And I\\'ve thrown all the devices in, or I\\'ll rip the router out of the wall. I mean, it\\'s gotten very ugly and I scream an awful lot. So yeah, it\\'s not pretty.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, so I\\'m hearing very similar themes from everyone about the challenges, especially with gaming. So that really brings us to the end, so thank you so much for taking out some time to really give us some details of your experiences. This is really helpful for our research. Administrator, are you available to come on for a minute, just to say hi and to talk about next steps?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi everyone, so just like Moderator 1 reiterated so much for taking the time out to participate in our focus group today. The information that you guys gave us is really helpful in what we\\'re trying to just [crosstalk 01:03:28]-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI can\\'t hear you.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n... the pandemic so we really appreciate that. If you\\'re not compensated by end of day tomorrow, you should get it by Friday. So the latest will be Friday and it will come through email. If you have any questions or concerns you can just email me back at any of the multiple emails that I\\'ve sent you guys. Or you can give me a call at my number, it\\'s at the bottom of those multiple emails that I sent you guys as well.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so I guess we\\'re done.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you. Thanks everyone.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you have a good afternoon everyone. Bye.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\n\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHey, Moderator 2.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHey.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:04:22]. So, yeah, there\\'s always going to be the talkers.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:04:26] the bell.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYour comment about Parent 5 was great. I could see... So, what do you think of dividing and conquering the rest, because I can\\'t sit and listen to this for three hours in a row-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThree hours a day. [crosstalk 01:04:48].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAs much fun as it is to hear people go on endlessly and not answer our questions. So would you be game for just splitting them up or-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAt the beginning of the day and figure out which ones\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah, why don\\'t we just touch base each day and see what we have.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nLike tomorrow, we have a 2:00 and 3:30 again.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI\\'m good to do either of those, whichever one works.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI think tomorrow I\\'ll do the 2:00.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAnd then Monday... We\\'ll just figure it out every day.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, yeah, sounds good.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:05:34].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, oh my God. Oh wait, how was Arizona?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt was great, it was really a lot of fun.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, good. Did your sister have a good time? Was it like-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWe did, we had a great time. It\\'s totally weird because there are zero COVID rules there.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nReally? That is weird.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThey\\'ve reopened as though nothing is wrong.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s like the opposite of California, I can see why it made sense to go there.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s weird too... We stayed at a hotel... We drove up to the Grand Canyon one day\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh, I was going to ask you if you ended up going up because I know... Yeah.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAnd then one day we stayed in central Phoenix. There was a bar just down the street from our hotel, and we went, and it was packed, and there was a dance floor, and no one had masks. We open the door and we\\'re like, oh, I thought it was going to be like in New York where do you have to sit at a table with just the three of us and a mask on. I was like, what is happening in here, you\\'re all going to die of COVID.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nBut if you\\'re on vacation, I\\'d rather do vacation that way and have the option to be free a little bit.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt was just funny to see, it felt very funny to see. You know?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s shocking to your system kind of.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah, we\\'ve all gotten so used to one way, seeing it you\\'re like, \"What is happening here\"?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, well I\\'m glad it was nice and you guys were actually able to go away with her that\\'s really-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 01:07:07] She was very happy we came.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThe flights were fine, they were packed though.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. They\\'re not doing anything to-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThere wasn\\'t one empty seat on either-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWow. I guess people are back to flying.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThey really are.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 01:07:24]. Oh, I am very into Good Girls also. I just came onto it a month ago and brought myself fully up to speed and I am\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI know, and now I have to wait for each episode to come out.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI know, I know. I watched it all so quickly, I should\\'ve spaced it out.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI love Christina Hendricks.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh my God, she\\'s awesome. I love the younger sister.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOh Ann Veal?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nFrom Arrested Development, God, [crosstalk 01:07:51].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWho?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nEgg, egg, right.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 01:07:58] That was the most disgusting... My kids happen to have seen that episode with me, Cara is always joking that she\\'s going to eat an egg and squirt bits of mayonnaise in her mouth. That\\'s why he calls her egg.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt makes me die of laughter every time someone says that.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh my God, yeah. But she\\'s like a whole different character on this, yeah.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nTotally different.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI know, but awesome also.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah, I just want to know what happens.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI know, I know. I don\\'t know if they\\'ll have another season after this. I feel like\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 01:08:34].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI could watch them do anything, they\\'re all great. [crosstalk 01:08:39] Parks and Rec person, because this is also Donna from Parks and Rec, who I loved.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:08:44].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nShe was an amazing character on Parks and Rec, the black one.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOh, Retta?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, they\\'re all great. All right Moderator 2-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nTalk to you tomorrow.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHave a good one. Bye.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWelcome back.'b'Parent 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:01:54].\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi. Good afternoon.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi. How are you?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nI\\'m good and you?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m good. Thanks.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAwesome. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. Moderator 2 didn\\'t respond to me. Just knock on the door.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nDo you want me to knock or?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHi. Good afternoon. I can\\'t hear anyone.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nEveryone\\'s on mute. That\\'s why.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah. We\\'ll give people another moment or two to join.\\n\\n\\tHi. All right, I guess we\\'ll get started and if anyone else joins we\\'ll take them at that point. Administrator, you\\'re muted. Administrator, you\\'re muted. Administrator? Administrator, you\\'re muted. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:06:29].\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nOkay. Thank you so much. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSorry, I couldn\\'t hear you, Administrator, you were muted. \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAll right. Sorry, Moderator 2, we just have one mom that just forgot, so she\\'s just going to fill out the consent form really, really quickly and then hop on the call.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay, so should we wait? \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSo sorry, I had my audio off as well.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. It\\'s alright. We couldn\\'t hear you because you were muted.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah. Sorry. So I\\'m not sure if you want to wait, we just-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:07:25] we\\'ll get started because I want to make sure we can have time to get through everything. So I just want to introduce myself. My name is Moderator 2. I\\'m the Director of the Healthy Brain Network, the Project Director of the Healthy Brain Network, and we\\'re here talking about your children\\'s use of electronics, technology during COVID, pre-COVID, and your concerns post-COVID and the return to school. \\n\\n\\tYou filled out the crisis survey, and that\\'s why you were selected to be a part of this study. I think what I like to do and the way I like to start these is a little bit of an ice-breaker and how we get to know each other. So if you want to introduce yourself, tell me your children\\'s names, ages and, I don\\'t know, your favorite TV show at the moment on Netflix that you\\'ve been binging. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can start. My name\\'s Parent 1. My son is named Parent 1, Child 1 and he is eight. [inaudible 00:08:41] forgive me, but I\\'m not watching any TV right now. I just- \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nA good book?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:08:50] and then when I do, when I have free time I just sort of collapse and [inaudible 00:08:56]. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI mean, I think a lot of us do that. Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYes. Hi, I\\'m Parent 2. My daughter\\'s Parent 2, Child 1 and she\\'s eight. Weirdly, I\\'m actually watching a show with my kids that I actually enjoy and I wouldn\\'t let them watch it while I was away. It\\'s Sulfur Springs on Disney Plus. Apparently, it\\'s one of their movies. I don\\'t know, it\\'s like a creepy mystery show. I think my kids are actually kind of scared maybe that\\'s why I\\'m... I think it\\'s a good show on TV. But it\\'s a cute show. So that\\'s currently what I\\'m watching.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s good. I have three kids. My daughter is 13 today actually, and I have two boys that are almost 10 and almost seven... Eight, sorry. One is turning eight in a few weeks. I\\'ve been watching a show called Good Girls. I don\\'t know why I love it. It\\'s about three seemingly suburban housewives who get into some sort of money laundering scam. It\\'s kind of funny.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s so good. Even though there\\'s actually some really criminal terrible things that happen in it, it\\'s a fun show.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:10:18] love Christina Hendricks, and I thought she was great in Mad Men. \\n\\n\\tAll right, if we can get started. I like doing this individual exercise where you can put down on a piece of paper two or three things that were positive in the ways technology affected your child\\'s life over the past year and two or three of the worst ways technology has impacted your child over the past year, and then choose the one that was most important to each of you and then overall. So for example, mine would be that overall, the use of technology has given my kids better tech skills. They used it a lot to keep in touch with family that they kept in touch with less previous to COVID. And when they use technology, whether it\\'s for Zoom, YouTube, or something else, it lets me work, which would be the most important part. The negatives are that they\\'re constantly playing games, it\\'s a struggle with bedtime and whining when I don\\'t let them use it. Overall, I think it\\'s more positive than negative. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAll right, I can go. This was a fast one for me. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSome positives are really voice to text, being able to do some additional classes on out school, because her school was a joke in Newark, and being able to stay in touch with friends. But all the bad sort of roll in together, she\\'s addicted, she\\'s a monster when she has to get off, and she can\\'t focus with school because she has no interest in doing the online classes. All she wants to do is play games. So every second I turn around, she\\'s trying to run away with the iPad or she\\'s doing class, but really she\\'s really secretly playing Roblox while she\\'s supposed to be on class. I actually see it way more as a negative than a positive. It\\'s changed who she is. She [inaudible 00:12:29] interesting child. She has no interest in going outside, she has no interest in seeing human beings, it\\'s allowed her anxiety to fester, I could go on and on. I like, hate it. I could send her to a wilderness school at eight years old for a year and have to disconnect from technology, and she wouldn\\'t miss her mother, I would send her off.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:13:00]. So Parent 1, Child 1 has really been able to text his friends and have playtime with his best friend so he doesn\\'t feel [inaudible 00:13:11] because of Roblox [inaudible 00:13:14]. And my family also, he Zooms with his cousins and [inaudible 00:13:26] before. And he\\'s really developed an interest in the way his [inaudible 00:13:28] works and so he\\'s like, \"Look, I can see the [inaudible 00:13:31]. I can hack it.\" So just that interest in figuring stuff out and solve them. But similarly on the negative side, it\\'s constant, it\\'s all he wants to do. He has no other interests. It\\'s always something we have to go over and it just becomes a big part of our relationship and [inaudible 00:13:57]. [inaudible 00:14:01] if it\\'s a overall positive or negative. I think [inaudible 00:14:04].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. All right. Well, I wanted to dig into the questions a little bit and you can just call out your answer as I\\'d like to hear from everyone. And I love differing view points, so we don\\'t all have to agree on one person\\'s views. But in terms of technology use for school, how did your child or children use technology for school purposes before the pandemic? Did you think it was beneficial? What were your concerns? Or, was it problematic? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nParent 1, Child 1 didn\\'t have any technology use [inaudible 00:14:51].\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nParent 2, Child 1 did not have any technology prior other than... Yeah, no, she had none. She was really not on it. It really wasn\\'t a part of our life.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi. My name is Parent 3. I showed up a little late, sorry everyone. So I have two sons, ages 7 and 10. They had very little interaction with electronics before the pandemic and now this is all... I mean, I\\'m sitting across from my child who\\'s supposed to be doing math work, and he\\'s on Friday Night Funkin\\' or whatever it is. I don\\'t know what it is, Roblox, whatever. I just see him over there jamming, and that\\'s not math. He\\'s not jamming to math. But this is what I deal with daily. I think they felt they were on vacation. This whole time they\\'ve just been on a never-ending vacation and [crosstalk 00:16:04]\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n... similar, they used to wait until I was on work meetings... Mine are back in school now, but they used to wait until I was in work meetings and then I would hear YouTube and I knew they were supposed to be in class. I could stare at them but I couldn\\'t scream at them because I was on with everyone at work.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYes, exactly. Same.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAs Administrator can testify [crosstalk 00:16:24] been on meetings where I\\'ve had to yell at my kids in the middle of a meeting and forget to mute myself.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThat happened to me once.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s happened more than once to me. We have this repeat meeting with everyone every day, and there have been countless times where I thought I muted and I didn\\'t.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAnd then we think that Moderator 2 is yelling at us. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYes. I\\'m always like, \"Put down that iPad,\" and then people are like, \"Wait, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry.\" And I was like, \"No, I don\\'t care what you... You work.\" It\\'s very funny.\\n\\n\\tSo it sounds like prior to the pandemic your children weren\\'t really using technology for school purposes, how were they using it during the pandemic? Were they on Zoom school the whole time? What were the struggles you found? Obviously, you\\'ve mentioned not doing schoolwork when they were supposed to, but what were some of the other issues you encountered?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI mean, I feel like my kids are watching a lot of inappropriate YouTube stuff too, stuff that I definitely don\\'t really want them exposed to that much, and I just am working and they know that they\\'re over there on YouTube. And it\\'s just one video, and then it brings up 50 other videos that you can click on. I feel like they just get progressively worse. I mean, sometimes I\\'ll overhear it and I\\'ll be like, \"Change that.\"\\n\\n\\tAlso, with the Chromebook, I feel like I don\\'t really like the Chromebooks. I wish we had done a real laptop because I\\'ve heard you can put a lot more restrictions on them. So one of our Chromebooks died, I don\\'t know, it just won\\'t take a charge, and Parent 2, Child 1\\'s is on its way out, so I think I\\'m going to switch her over to a laptop where I can put in a lot more restrictions. \\n\\n\\tWe\\'re also working with a cognitive behavioral therapist for her and we will be putting time restrictions on the iPad using, not the timer one because my kids just ignore limit. That one\\'s like, no. He sent us another one where you can actually like... This thing\\'s going off. So yeah, I mean, it\\'s a time thing. I feel like she\\'s constantly... That\\'s the only goal. Even if she does something, it\\'s solely to get the iPad. Even if she\\'s nice to someone, it\\'s solely to get the iPad. It\\'s like the focus of her life now. I just feel like it\\'s made her into a less interesting kid. Like I said, it\\'s disappointing. She was always outside and wanting to play with kids in the beginning of the pandemic, when it was just Zoom school and she really hadn\\'t been introduced to Minecraft or Roblox or any of that stuff yet. She actually just did the class and then went outside and played. But when she discovered that over the summer, the decline was so fast into addiction, I was like, \"Wow.\"\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. In terms of returning to in-person school, have your children started to return to school yet?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy son is pretty much back at school [inaudible 00:19:33] school\\'s open when [inaudible 00:19:35]. He generally [inaudible 00:19:42].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. How has the return been in terms of their technology use?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHe still wants to be on Roblox all the time [inaudible 00:19:53]. So he doesn\\'t have any assignments from school that are [inaudible 00:20:00].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSo I have one at home still with me, and the other one, the older one, I sent back to school. He has autism and ADHD. The one that\\'s here has ADHD. So he is getting speech and OT and all of that, and it was better to just send him back. As soon as they opened up, I was like, \"Okay, you got to go back.\" Well, actually I waited a little while because the numbers had gone back up for a little while and so I was concerned but there were only two other kids in his classroom, so I said let\\'s do it. He needs the structure and there\\'s just... Like you said, Moderator 2, I have work meetings, I mean I\\'m answering emails through the night practically, so I just felt like it was just better for him to be in school. But he uses an iPad for school, they use the iPad in school, which I don\\'t love but he loves it, and then when he comes home, he wants to play on the iPad. So it\\'s like iPad, 24/7. So it\\'s a lot.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, we are back. So I didn\\'t mention I had two other kids, I guess I should, so we\\'ve sort of taken an approach that we had the ability... Because my parents live in Connecticut, so I moved the middle child, the first-grader, Parent 2, Child 2, to a school in Connecticut. They\\'re full-time. It is amazing. If they do close, which is very rarely, they do live synchronous learning so I don\\'t have to be their teacher, I don\\'t have to step away from my work day. The teacher actually answers questions. My little guy\\'s two, so he is in pretend school/daycare. \\n\\n\\tBut Parent 2, Child 1, her school, she\\'s still virtual for her school in Manhattan. They actually are back full-time, every grade now except for the pre-K, but I chose... She had been hybrid, and I chose to mover her to all virtual when they decided to go back full-time. The reason I did that was because of the six-foot rule, and even if it was the three-foot rule, which the UFT hasn\\'t adopted yet, the entire second grade is in the cafeteria. So my dyslexic, ADHD kid, which is just the tip of the iceberg of her issues, is supposed to be in a cafeteria with every single second grader, no partitions, teachers using microphones, the specials are all still via computer. \\n\\n\\tSo whereas, Parent 2, Child 2 in Connecticut is getting live special... She gets to go on a real playground all day, she has a first best friend, a second best friend, a third best friend. And Parent 2, Child 1 just would get to go sit six feet apart from a kid and have a teacher use a microphone while three other teachers are using microphones. It was just ridiculous. And with her issues and being further behind, we just figured... And she\\'s not doing school at home obviously, but we\\'re hiring tutors. So we\\'re educating her, not our school currently. \\n\\n\\tI have said this morning I\\'m actually trying to get Parent 2, Child 1 into a private school for next year, so soon I\\'ll be taking this call on the road because they called me this morning that they want her in for a math evaluation this afternoon. So it\\'s really frustrating. \\n\\n\\tSo our school is back, but I\\'m tired of hearing people say things are back because I think it\\'s back in such a way that\\'s so terrible that for some kids, especially ones with... The way that they\\'re setup, it\\'s not back for her. I feel like even for the best students in that school, it\\'s not a great situation, not when you compare it to what my other daughter has here in Connecticut. It\\'s really disappointing in my opinion. \\n\\n\\tI obviously have a lot of opinions on this. I\\'m on our school leadership team too and I\\'m a very vocal member of it, so... Yeah. I don\\'t know, it\\'s been frustrating. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. In terms of challenges in returning to school, what do you expect in the future your children will struggle with in terms of being back in the classroom full-time?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI know for me, my biggest concern is I\\'ve seen his ADHD spike, I guess, since he\\'s been home. Maybe it\\'s always been there, it\\'s just that I have my eye on it now. He\\'s in front of me so I could really tell that it\\'s escalating or whatever, and I\\'m just really nervous that when he goes back into the classroom they won\\'t be able to control him or they won\\'t be able to teach him. I just think he\\'s going to be out of hand. He\\'s going to be off schedule. Just not used to being regimented in any way, and I think it\\'s a ... I\\'m nervous about him going back, I\\'ll put it like that.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut to also play on that, I agree, I have a lot of the same concerns. But I also anticipate there being so many kids like that that it\\'s just a disaster in that classroom. I feel like so many kids are going to be such hot messes with various issues, maybe ADHD, maybe they\\'re super behind in writing now or [crosstalk 00:25:52] issues and they\\'re struggling. I mean, I feel like so many kids have regressed and the social anxiety and there\\'s just so many things. I just feel like how can the teachers... And that\\'s one of the reason I\\'m trying to take this show over to private for my one with all the issues, is because they\\'re so small, and those kids have been in full-time [inaudible 00:26:13] my kid that\\'s a problem kid. But I mean, how can these teachers deal with this? Especially some of the schools that are really big with only one teacher that don\\'t even have TAs and that sort of help. My kid\\'s always been in an ICT classroom with two teachers, but in general those classes have been very big. There are still usually at least 27 kids and half of them have an IEP, and I would imagine that if my kid with her IEP is struggling, she\\'s probably not the only one. So I would think that it\\'s going to be a bit of a disaster. Maybe I\\'m wrong. Maybe that\\'s just the pessimist in me.  \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI wanted to ask a couple of other questions in terms of gaming and your children because a lot of you have mentioned Roblox, which is something that my kids play as well, how did your children\\'s use of gaming... What was it like before the pandemic? Was it beneficial to you or to them? Or did it cause a problem?  \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, I joined late, I do have an answer to this if you\\'d like it. My name\\'s Parent 4. My daughter\\'s name is Parent 4, Child 1. She was not a player of video games. We had a pandemic birthday last year, we\\'re coming on the same... It\\'s the same time from last year, but we were desperate to save the day and try to make some happiness out of something terrible and we bought her a Nintendo Switch, which has been great and terrible at the exact same time. She has been able to foster really good relationships with friends that she already knew and deepen those relationships. \\n\\n\\tThere was a friend of mine that... I was in a moms group, and she was like six months old, and that kid somehow found... The mom said, \"I have a kid your age, please can we connect them on Animal Crossing?\" And they played Animal Crossing, they became really good friends. And then she played this other game called BlockStar with another friend of hers from Hebrew school. And since she went back to school she\\'s been best friends with another kid in her class and they play Fortnight and a bunch of other games. \\n\\n\\tSo she wasn\\'t really playing many video games. She played solitary video games, she would play by herself, but now she plays with other people. The thing is now she wants to do it all the time. She doesn\\'t really want to do other stuff.  \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI mean, I have said before we really didn\\'t do games before the pandemic, but sort of a good and bad thing. I mean, now that she\\'s obsessed and addicted, and we\\'ve started cognitive behavioral therapy for her, we\\'re about three weeks in, but guess what we\\'re using to bribe her behavior, that she can earn? It\\'s Roblox. I\\'m basically feeding the addiction to get the behavior change I want but it is a... Right now, we started small with some of the behavioral changes. But next week, or even really starting tomorrow, we\\'re going to a little bigger with the iPad restriction, which we hadn\\'t incorporated yet. He wanted to do a couple weeks of just go small before we go big, but it\\'s still using Roblox as basically a bribery tool/reward on the cognitive behavioral reward chart. So I feel like as much as I\\'m hating it, I\\'m also feeding it.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo my son was [inaudible 00:30:38] before the pandemic started [inaudible 00:30:38] and I always had a problem with it. Personally, I wasn\\'t a gamer and so I didn\\'t get it and [inaudible 00:30:50]. But I guess sort of in the pandemic, [inaudible 00:30:59] video game addiction webinar that I listened to, and it was really helpful because it just sort of laid [inaudible 00:31:11] there re positives and there are negatives, and you should worry if it gets to the point where they\\'re not eating, [inaudible 00:31:19] interested in other things. And I think the interest in other things was [inaudible 00:31:24]. \\n\\n\\tBut the other thing they can [inaudible 00:31:32] focusing on positives and, \"You should do this\" [inaudible 00:31:35]video games, but I\\'ve also sort of come to accept it more because I\\'m seeing how they help kids [inaudible 00:31:51]. And there are definitely positives that [inaudible 00:31:58]. So yeah, I\\'m still guilty of it. It really works though [inaudible 00:32:13] in school performance stuff because he just wouldn\\'t even try to do the assignments and now he\\'s [inaudible 00:32:26] and he\\'s actually working [inaudible 00:32:27] all of that [inaudible 00:32:33]. I can\\'t [inaudible 00:32:38] myself from this whole thing now. It\\'s a part of our lives and [inaudible 00:32:41].\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt allowed my daughter to spend time with friends when everything was locked down. It was a way for her to actually be with other kids. On New Year\\'s Eve, she spent a lot of time with her friend in Animal Crossing, that\\'s like the coolest thing I\\'ve ever heard of. I mean, New Year\\'s Eve with your friend, all night in Animal... I mean, it wasn\\'t real but they were hanging out and they also video chat at the same time. It\\'s not like hanging out with a real person, I mean it is a real person but it\\'s not like in the same room, but it was something when she had nothing, and there\\'s something for that.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt definitely is. But it sounds like a lot of your share the same experience of pre-pandemic your children didn\\'t have a lot to do with gaming and being online often and during the pandemic that shifted to being partially a large problem, partially something that you\\'ve depended on to give them some socialization and some sort of sense of normalcy. Is that correct?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI would say so. Also me though, my boys did play games before the pandemic, it\\'s just it\\'s magnified now. It\\'s more games now. We also got them both Switchs I think in the last year or so, the Switchs add to it. They each have an iPad now. It\\'s too much. Plus the school iPads. \\n\\n\\tI haven\\'t used the Roblox as an incentive, but I feel like that\\'s a good idea. I know we\\'re supposed to be trying to steer away from it but I actually like that idea. But I have started doing this where they get iPad privileges. So if you finish your homework, if you cleanup, if you whatever it is, put your plate in the sink after you eat, all of that will give you iPad privileges. And your privileges will get taken away if you are fighting with your brother or whatever it is. I\\'ve had to put that in place. \\n\\n\\tI\\'ve tried to do the time restraint thing, but if I don\\'t set a timer I will forget and then they\\'ll be on for five hours because I\\'m on my own, doing my own thing. I\\'ll check in with them, everybody\\'s fine, nobody\\'s killing each other, okay, but if I don\\'t set an alarm then I\\'ll forget. So the timer thing has not been easy. They also obviously push back when the time is up, so it hasn\\'t been easy.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI\\'m going to say I\\'ve experienced the same thing. It works too well, all of a sudden they\\'re gone. You know what I mean? And it could be a long time. Uninterrupted time as a parent is so valuable and awesome that when it comes along, you\\'re just doing stuff. You\\'re just doing stuff, work, whatever it is you need to do, and then all of a sudden it\\'s been a long time and you\\'re like, \"I haven\\'t seen my child all day, what have they been doing?\" That I know is not right, but it\\'s not like... And the whole them doing school at home thing, we suck. I work at a school, I\\'m a school social worker, I\\'m great at school, I know school, but with my own child\\'s school, I don\\'t know what it. They\\'re just like, \"Make sure to go in the classroom\" and blah, blah, blah. They didn\\'t really give us really adequate instructions and stuff, and there was a whole bunch of stuff. And we\\'d get bad report cards every fricking day from the teachers like, \"Oh by the way, your child didn\\'t do their homework,\" and it\\'s a lot to keep track of and it\\'s not easy to do that. I don\\'t know just having her quiet, it\\'s just so nice, but it\\'s terrible.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI can completely relate to that. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIt was the hardest part [inaudible 00:37:31] whole month of November and the month in March, all the months that we had to just [inaudible 00:37:51] unless we were [crosstalk 00:37:52].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI can\\'t hear... There was an-\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:37:52] need you to mute. Awesome.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBut yeah, if we gave him any slack, any space, he would be on either Roblox or he would be watching [inaudible 00:38:15] so I had to be on top of it [inaudible 00:38:19] and he wasn\\'t even... They had an hour and 45 minutes where they were [inaudible 00:38:37] and they were asked to just [inaudible 00:38:54].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. In terms of looking at the full return to school, how do you think you will be impacted and how do you think your child will be impacted in terms of their use of gaming? Because I think part of the common problem I\\'m hearing from all of you is you\\'ve gotten used to using gaming to your benefit, your child has gotten used to gaming and it\\'s turned into a problem, but while they were home it seems like there was not much else to depend on. Now that they\\'re going back to school they won\\'t have that time availability. So how do you think that\\'s going to be a challenge for you or for them?  \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can say from experience [inaudible 00:39:41] pretty much [inaudible 00:39:42]-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI can\\'t hear you, sorry?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSince I feel like there\\'s already full-time back in school, that transition was... We definitely had to start getting feedback from his teacher, we are using Roblox as an incentive for him to be engaged in school, so we had to sort of support [inaudible 00:40:06] to do. And he still complains about, \"Oh, I only have two hours to play\" when he gets home after school, and we\\'re like, \"You [inaudible 00:40:21].\" So he complains about it and we have to sort of incentivize [inaudible 00:40:24] school to help him [inaudible 00:40:27].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nFor my one kid that\\'s already back at school she basically plays it until the moment she steps into that school or out of my car. And the moment she gets off the bus and I get her home, she\\'s back on it again until she goes to bed. I mean, I guess it\\'s better in the sense that she has several hours that\\'s she\\'s not on it, but it\\'s all about that from the moment she wakes up till the moment she goes to bed. I mean, it\\'s still an issue in terms of, I think, just socialization and stuff. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI know for me it\\'s an issue just because they don\\'t want to do anything else. Socialization is not even a problem. They just want to eat and play video games. My 10-year-old will actually say, \"I just want to play,\" that\\'s it. I have to fight with them to do school work. \\n\\n\\tAs a matter of fact, the other day, he came in, he did... Let\\'s say there\\'s a vocabulary assignment, he does the vocabulary assignment and he\\'s like, \"I\\'m done. Can I have the iPad now?\" So I say, \"You finished all your homework?\" \"Yeah, I\\'m done.\" \"No, math today?\" \"No, no math.\" And of course, now I\\'m like, \"Okay, fine, go play the iPad.\" So now it\\'s like two hours later, and I check the folder, and we\\'re eating dinner and then he\\'s going to get washed up and go to bed, there\\'s really a math worksheet that needed to be done. So they have no clue about priorities. Their only priority is to whatever build their city in Minecraft and beat whatever, I don\\'t know, creeper or whatever. I don\\'t know. Bless you. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBut that\\'s been our biggest issue. So the one that has already gone back to school, when he comes home, it\\'s just tunnel vision to get to playing the iPad. Whatever he has to do or whatever he has to not to do to get to the iPad. So that\\'s where we are with that.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. What other feedback do you want to talk about in terms of your child and their use of gaming? We have a few minutes left. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m mostly curious of how would we get them off it, the best way to transition them back into society, I feel like, instead of their virtual world. I mean, that\\'s, I think, my biggest concern at this point is doing that. I\\'m hoping summer camp will help, we\\'re definitely sending ours to summer camp, two weeks of sleep-away camp with no technology and then six weeks at day camp. Can\\'t send a two-year-old, but I\\'m sending the six and eight-year-old. So I\\'m just curious any good resources, books, I don\\'t know, tools, detox program from it.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWell, we are certainly going to invite you to our town hall where we will discuss the feedback from these sessions and maybe make some suggestions for interventions you can use. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI just think that there are some things about video games. I think that\\'s there\\'s problem-solving, if there\\'s reading involved, there\\'s... I can\\'t believe how much she\\'s been able to learn about Minecraft. It\\'s amazing. There are skills involved in this. It\\'s not entirely useless. It\\'s just, how do we capitalize on the good and mitigate the bad? And I think that that\\'s really hard. I mean, I just wish that my kid would be as interested in doing her homework to the extent that she\\'s interested in... I don\\'t know. I can\\'t believe what she\\'s acquired in Animal Crossing. She\\'s not even interested in it anymore, but her island got three or four stars or whatever. There\\'s merit to it, I guess, is where I\\'m coming from. I would hate that the only answer would be to never do it again or to not do it at all, or to do it so little that whatever good would... I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\tI have a brother who\\'s a year younger than me, and he was an OG gamer. He\\'s a lost child, he doesn\\'t work, he plays video games every day. I know that this has some really terrible consequences, but there are good parts also.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI could definitely see that.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah. I have to say that my son has actually been great [inaudible 00:46:07]-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI can\\'t hear you, Parent 1.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, I guess my audio\\'s not very good. Is this better if I\\'m closer?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay. Sorry about that. I have to say that my son has been able to have some really successful social interactions. When we say it\\'s time to go out, time to go and do something, and we sort of force the issue, he has a lot of fun and he usually really gets engaged in things. That\\'s something that we were... A huge challenge to do before, like we would go to the park and he\\'d be like, \"I just want to go home.\" He\\'d be uncomfortable or insecure about social interaction. And I feel like he\\'s gotten so much more confident by not having that [inaudible 00:46:53] social interaction but actually this virtual version of it. It feels like he\\'s gotten more confidence. So there is good things about this, but we have to really force him to have those in-person experiences. So that\\'s where I\\'ve been trying to just focus on like, \"What are we going to do? What are we going to do do instead of video games?\" [inaudible 00:47:19] swimming every week now, just figuring out what we can offer to him that [inaudible 00:47:27].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. Does anyone else have anything they\\'d like to add before we wrap up?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nJust that it\\'s nice to see that there are other people in a similar situation. I live in a town where everybody like, \"You know what I do, I make sure my child never has video games.\" There\\'s no shortage of people trying to rub it in your face how great they are, and I\\'m sick of that. Don\\'t want it.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAdministrator is laughing because during work meetings I have shared my experiences, and I\\'m like, \"I\\'m so tired of scrolling through Facebook and reading about people who are like, \\'Today, I planned a scavenger hunt around my town,\\'\" and I\\'m like, \"I live in Riverdale, in the Bronx, I don\\'t have time to plan a scavenger hunt. I have a job.\" I\\'m like, \"Can you come pick up my kids because it seems like you have a lot of time?\" I felt parent-shamed because... But I think it\\'s a very common experience. \\n\\n\\tIt\\'s funny because there are focus groups about children and their use of social media, gaming and things like that, and I find that parent use is impacted as well, and how we shame each other and how we feel it, and we feel like, \"Oh my God, does this make me a terrible parent?\" In the past six weeks, I\\'ve managed to go do one thing with my kids, I\\'m talking about during the pandemic, I\\'m like, \"There\\'s nowhere to go, there\\'s nothing to do,\" and I just think it\\'s a funny reaction to have when you look at it and you look at someone posting pictures of a scavenger hunt they did that involved 17 parks and things they... And I\\'m like, \"Would you go out at 2:00 o\\'clock in the morning and hide things? Who are these people and why do they have so much time?\" \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s making me laugh. I can\\'t even imagine that. But I agree too, it makes me feel better that there\\'s other people out there who aren\\'t planning scavenger hunts and taking their kid on farm field trips during the workday and their kids are also watching YouTube and playing Roblox.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nMy ex and I kept calling each other during the pandemic, and we\\'re just like, \"Are other people working? Is [inaudible 00:49:53] happens? Where do these people find time to plan events like this?\" Even during the summer, I send my kids to day camp and sleep-away camp, and my hope\\'s that they\\'ll be kept busy, but during the pandemic there was no option. And I think it\\'s good for parents to talk to each other in an honest way and not worry about the judgment piece of exactly those things like, \"Did we plan 17 events this week?\" \\n\\n\\tI\\'m not running a children\\'s activity program, I do my best, but I think you all are doing your best. I think it\\'s very hard when we become dependent on... This transition, I think, was challenging for people in a sense of if you are working and if you have a normal life prior to the pandemic and then suddenly you are now dealing with your child at home all the time instead of being at school so you could do your job. So a lot of people relied on things like technology and devices to give themselves the time to get their jobs done instead of just being on top of their children all day. So it\\'s an adjustment. \\n\\n\\tI don\\'t know exactly what it\\'s going to look like once kids are back in school full-time, because mine are, but I still struggle with their use of technology on weekends. Now they don\\'t want to do anything. I don\\'t fight with them because there\\'s not that much to do, like when we\\'re going to go to the park and then they don\\'t want to go, and I\\'m like, \"Well, I don\\'t want you sitting on your device all day.\" It\\'s just an argument.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nBut it is a bummer, I\\'ll tell you because the other day we wanted to go to Costco, and my husband and I were so excited. We were like, \"Oh my gosh, Costco. It\\'s like the bast date in the world. Oh yeah, Costco,\" and we added on Duck Donuts because we were like, \"Hey, if you come, after we\\'ll go to the... \" It\\'s not enough. Not enough. So, I don\\'t know. But thank you for your honesty, all of you. This was like a bomb for my soul. I didn\\'t have to hear, \"Well, we don\\'t allow social media in our house.\"\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSo I have this joke with my ex and with one of my friends where we constantly screenshot things on Instagram or Facebook, and then we send it to each other with liar, liar, liar underneath, because I think they are. I\\'m sorry, I\\'m just going to go right out and say it. I don\\'t think it\\'s true.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nA lot of people are lying about their activities.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:52:43] friends with who are parents who are, if we\\'re honest with each other, we\\'re all experiencing the same thing. I think just a takeaway for you is if your honest with your friends, close friends about this, and you\\'re just like, \"I\\'m really struggling,\" the second you say it, they\\'re going to be like, \"Yeah, me too.\" Instead of everybody pretending that, \"Oh my God, this was glorious. I became so close to my children.\" And I\\'m like, \"I\\'ve screamed more than I have my whole life.\"\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nPrior to the pandemic, I remember saying... I worked at least 50, 60 hours a week, so before this I was like, \"I need to spend more time with my kids. I need to spend more time with my kids.\" Now I\\'m like, \"I\\'m spending way too much time with my kids.\" So yeah, it has been a challenge. The other day, my son\\'s doctor, we took him to see a ADHD specialist, and she told me that he should be outside in the park for three hours a day. Who has the kind of time-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThree hours?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThree hours a day. I was like, \"I\\'m going to have to pay somebody to do that because I certainly cannot do it.\" I can\\'t do it. And I still haven\\'t done it. Some days, we don\\'t even leave the house, and I feel bad because I\\'m so busy I just don\\'t have the time to leave the house with him. And it\\'s not like I have a house where he can go in the backyard and run around, I\\'m in an apartment in Brooklyn so he definitely cannot go outside without me. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWell, if it makes you feel better, our CBT therapist has us only doing 20 minutes outside a day, and there\\'s a couple days a week we don\\'t even meet that. So I\\'m like, \"Three hours?\" That\\'s blown my mind.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI can\\'t even do 20 minutes. No, I could try to do... That\\'s more of a realistic goal though, 20 minutes a day. Three hours a day, not happening. On the weekends maybe. And even that, I don\\'t want to be in a park for three hours.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWhat are you going to do in a park for three hours?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nRight, I can\\'t [inaudible 00:54:51]. No way. I can\\'t even put my head down and scroll through Instagram or whatever for that long. That means kids will disappearing, no way.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah. My running joke has been, I understand that this is parenting and parenting doesn\\'t always come with a handbook, but this is not what I signed up for. I thought I had to do diapers and everything else for a couple of years and then they go to school and life is somewhat normal for a lot of years, and then they graduate and et cetera. I did not know that there was going to be a time period of them being home 24 hours a day, seven days a week for a year.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nBut you know what? I don\\'t think we\\'re going to remember the bad parts.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nNo, I know. I think it\\'ll be fine in the end and children will adapt, it\\'s just going to take some time.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nFor reals. And whoever said they\\'re sending their kid to camp for two weeks, God bless you. I\\'m sending my kid for as long as I can.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNo, it\\'s two weeks of sleep-away but then six weeks of day camp, so it\\'s eight weeks total. That\\'s the max I can manage to find.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWell, I\\'m doing two sessions of I think it\\'s six weeks of sleep-away. It\\'s like, bye.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:56:08] I\\'m trying to convince her to do the second four-week session in equestrian camp [inaudible 00:56:16] only agreed to one. I\\'m coaching her to agree to a second four weeks.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nToo much togetherness. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI was wondering, because my son is... He was diagnosed with ADHD this last summer and we haven\\'t started the cognitive behavioral therapy [inaudible 00:56:41] that\\'s recommended, can I just take a second to ask you guys, does it help? What\\'s the experience like? Is it a fixed amount of time that you have to commit or is it just open-ended therapy?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWell, we\\'re about three weeks in and I\\'m already seeing a significant improvement in some of the struggles that we had on a daily basis that have already just now become of the routine, and it is time commitment on mine and my husband\\'s part. We also have to meet with the therapist every week for 45 minutes. Luckily, that\\'s virtual. So I mean, from the perspective of time, it\\'s more on the parent\\'s time than the kid\\'s time. And we\\'ve been lucky that the initial jump into it has been okay, but as you go along we are increasing the demands on her. So we do anticipate more struggle for the ODD to come out a little bit more in the coming weeks because it\\'s supposed to get worse before it gets better. But I\\'ve seen a significant improvement in things we could not just get her to work on. She\\'s dyslexic and didn\\'t want to write at all because it was frustrating, and now everyday she writes two sentences in a journal. No problem. Just the playing outside and... We started small, but I\\'ve seen a big difference and it\\'s only been three weeks. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYou should have a podcast, man. You should totally have a podcast, like the pandemic truth.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAll right, well thank you guys so much for participating today. The information you\\'ve shared has been really helpful. If you have any questions, you can always email us. Administrator, do you want to explain reimbursement for a bit and then we\\'ll wrap up?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. So as Moderator 2 said, thank you guys so much for participating today. I just also want to let you guys know that the information that you gave us today is very consistent with the information that we\\'ve gotten with our other groups, so please don\\'t feel alone in your struggles that you\\'ve been facing with the pandemic. That just speaks to the importance of pursuing these focus groups and having these town hall meetings and getting this information to you guys. So thank you for that.\\n\\n\\tIn regards to compensation, you should receive it by end of day tomorrow, no later than Monday. So as soon as this group is done, I\\'m going to send this information over to our administrator who deals with compensation stuff. If you don\\'t receive compensation by Monday, please feel free to reach out to me via email or to give me a call at [inaudible 00:59:27] multitude of emails that I\\'ve sent you guys and just let me know. Once again, just thank you guys so much for your time.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI love your glasses, Administrator.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThank you so much. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThanks for having us.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThanks everyone. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nBye-bye.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHang in there everyone.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nGoodbye. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:59:55].'b'Parent 1:\\n\\n(silence) Hi!\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi there.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHello.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi. How are you?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m good. Sorry I\\'m late. I can\\'t figure this out, so-\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYou\\'re actually on time, so-\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, good!\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThat\\'s perfect. (silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi everyone. I\\'m Moderator 1.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHello.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks for joining. We\\'re just going to wait for a couple more people to come. How many people are we expecting today, Administrator?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nFive.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nFive. Okay, cool. All right, so we\\'ll wait for more people to sign on, then we\\'ll get started. (silence)\\n\\n\\tHi, [Parent 2 00:05:53]. Welcome. Thanks for joining. We\\'re just waiting, I think, for one or two more people. So hopefully we\\'ll get started in a couple of minutes or so. (silence)\\n\\n\\tAdministrator, what do you think? Do you think we should... Oh, she\\'s on the phone. Sorry.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n2:10? [crosstalk 00:07:48] Or... Yeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. 2:10 sounds good. (silence)\\n\\n\\tHi, Parent 1 Welcome. We\\'re going to get started in a minute or so. (silence)\\n\\n\\tOkay. So I think that there\\'s still one more person who\\'s going to join us, but we can get started at least with some introductions. So my name is Moderator 1. I\\'m a neuropsychologist with the Healthy Brain Network. Thank you so much for taking some time to speak with us today. These focus groups have been really helpful, if just giving us a deeper understanding of issues that families are facing. And one of the things that we\\'re seeing is that people are having really different experiences. And I think some people are having shared experiences, and then some people are having unique experiences. And I just want to encourage you that even if you\\'re experiencing something different than what someone else is saying to please speak up. If you\\'re experiencing something similar, please speak up. We really just want to hear from everyone. So maybe we could just start by going around, just introduce yourself, your name, and tell us how many kids you have and what their ages are. Just so we understand. Parent 2, you want to start us off? You\\'re in the top-right of my screen.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Parent 2. I have two kids, a boy and a girl. My son is 12. My daughter\\'s 10, almost 11. I guess, I don\\'t know. What else did you want to know in the introduction? Sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s it for now. Thank you, Parent 2. Perfect. So I see Anthony Hill, but I\\'m not sure if that\\'s your name.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi. No, it\\'s Parent 1. It\\'s under my husband\\'s name and I couldn\\'t figure out how to change it on my... I\\'m not as savvy as my teenage son on computers. So I have two children. Two boys, one 13 and one eight. And a little dog that\\'s sitting on my lap. Hi! So, that\\'s it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, great. We\\'d like to hear about the dog\\'s experiences during COVID also. Okay, and Parent 3? Can you hear us? I don\\'t think we can hear you, Parent 3. I\\'m not sure if you can hear us, but maybe write to us in the chat if there\\'s something we can help with. [Parent 4 00:13:17]? Introduce yourself.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Parent 4. I\\'m at work, so I\\'ll turn my camera on and off. So, sorry. I\\'m the mom of a 16-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for joining us. Administrator, Maybe you could reach out to Parent 3 and see...\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSo she\\'s at work. I\\'m not sure if she\\'s muted, but she told me that she would mute and unmute whenever she needed to.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo whenever you\\'re able to speak, just let us know and speak up. We\\'d like to hear from you also. So I was thinking, let\\'s start with an exercise, just to kind of organize some thoughts about technology and how it\\'s affected your kid\\'s life over the course of the pandemic. So if you can just take a minute to jot down two or three positive ways that technology has impacted your child over the pandemic, and maybe two or three negative ways that technology has impacted your child over the pandemic. And then we\\'ll discuss it. (silence)\\n\\n\\tOnce you\\'ve outlined a couple, also circle whichever group had the biggest impact. So, positive group had the biggest overall impact, circle that. If the negative group had the biggest overall impact, circle that one. (silence)\\n\\n\\tOkay. So by show of hands, who circled the positive group as having the bigger overall impact over the course of the pandemic? Parent 4, no? Okay. So did all three of you circle the negative group as having the bigger overall effect? Okay. So let\\'s get into that a little bit. So I guess the first question that we can discuss is... Let\\'s talk a little bit about how did your children use technology before the pandemic? Did you think that technology was a problem? Did you have concerns or problems with their use of technology for educational purposes before the pandemic and their usage? So whoever wants to speak first can go ahead.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI can speak. So I- [crosstalk 00:17:26] Sure. So my 16-year-old, I don\\'t think that he... I mean, I guess they must\\'ve used technology before, but... I guess they used Google classroom and stuff, but not as much as they obviously did during the pandemic. They always had PupilPath and different things to, sort of, follow their assignments. But I think during the pandemic, my son, the 16-year-old, has ADHD. And so, he has two screens in his room. So on one screen, there\\'s a Zoom with his class. And on the other screen, he\\'s playing video games. And to me, it\\'s just very frustrating and it\\'s been... You can\\'t take technology away from them because they need it for school. So that\\'s been a very frustrating part of the whole experience. And he feels like he\\'s not really learning very much because, well, I mean, I would say it\\'s because he\\'s playing video games while they\\'re trying to teach him. But he says it\\'s just not conducive to his learning, so.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGotcha. So it\\'s been a distraction, but it\\'s just challenging because you can\\'t really limit it because he\\'s also using it for school. So you can\\'t place the same limits that you used to. Thanks, Parent 4. Yeah, Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can go next. So what was the question? It was...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo I guess just speaking a little bit about how did your- [crosstalk 00:19:14]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, before and after.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nUse technology before the pandemic, did you have any concerns before? And then-\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThey never really-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou can speak a little bit to how that changed.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo they never, definitely my eight-year-old, never used technology for school. They don\\'t even have homework at that age. My 13-year-old, he also has ADD, ADHD and he has an IEP and all that stuff. And so, he would do his homework at school. So I don\\'t even know what he\\'d used in terms of technology, but he didn\\'t use it at home. That\\'s for sure. And then afterwards, he had to use it for... It\\'s the same situation with the two screens, and he would have his Chromebook open doing school. And then I can\\'t helicopter him, so-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBecause I\\'m working full-time from home. So I\\'m jumping between mom hat, work hat. And so I go in there into his room and I have to keep the door open because then I can\\'t trust him. He sneaks it and he has another screen going. It\\'s like crack, it\\'s like a drug, like he has to have it. And I\\'m like, \"You don\\'t play at school, video games. So why would you think you can do it during school hours at home?\" And then he\\'s, \"Of course. Of course, Mom.\" And then he does it anyway. So there\\'s the sneaking. And really, I can\\'t put any limits on him because that\\'s not just for school. It\\'s also how they socialize. So he\\'s not seeing his friends at school. So how... Anyway, I think that before it was almost non-existence in terms of education.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd then it was really just not effective at home because I couldn\\'t monitor it. And because of the ADHD, I think he had a really hard time just logging in to show that he was present for the class. So he had like 40 absences and I\\'m like, \"No, he didn\\'t have 40 absences. He was online. He did the work. I saw him online. He just didn\\'t check in.\" And so, it just ended up being one negative thing after the other. And he\\'s getting in trouble with his teachers and he missed assignments. And it was a nightmare. And the Chromebooks were really an issue. They\\'re not as capable as they should be. And they- [crosstalk 00:21:53]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIn terms of what? In terms of being able to filter or block or- [crosstalk 00:21:57]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIn terms of what they can do. And the ease of use, too.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd the filters. The filters, for sure. But also the ease of use. He should have been able to log into his Chromebook and then log into that class and boom! Automatically be counted as present. [crosstalk 00:22:09] But now, you have to go through seven steps to get there.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. [crosstalk 00:22:13]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI mean-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnd it\\'s just a new organizational thing that he has to do, which could be very confusing. [crosstalk 00:22:16]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, which he can\\'t do anyway! [crosstalk 00:22:17]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, with organizational- [crosstalk 00:22:19]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI mean, even he\\'s got to do Google Classroom, now he has to check email-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nNow he has to check the instant chats and the non-instant chats. I don\\'t know, just-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s a lot of extra responsibilities that are very independent and it\\'s... Yeah. [crosstalk 00:22:36]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYep. And I couldn\\'t figure it out, so how\\'s he going to figure it out? [crosstalk 00:22:38]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, yeah. And the social part is interesting, also, that you\\'re saying. That it also makes it hard to limit.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can\\'t take it away from him.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can\\'t take the drug away.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s his only outlet, even now. That\\'s just how it... I don\\'t know if that\\'s how it would normally be anyway, just because of their age and the era that we live in. It\\'s a digital age, so maybe it would have been anyway, but-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, but it\\'s an extra complication, sounds like. All right.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd extra screen time on top of extra screen time, so.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 2, can you speak a little bit, your kids\\' usage before and how that changed during the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSure. It\\'s pretty similar to what you guys are saying. My son is the oldest, he\\'s 12, so he didn\\'t really use technology much in school. He\\'s ADHD, as well as dyslexic. So purposefully, they avoided technology just for the process of writing is better. So he did use some apps for reading, like Learning Ally for reading and stuff. But basically, one positive thing is he\\'s definitely learned how to type, which is amazing. At first I would watch him. It was so tedious. It was painful. For him, some parts would have been positive, like learning to type, it actually helped him be a little more organized because all of his work was in Google Classroom instead of forgetting papers at school. And so, he would get a notification from his teacher that he had work to do, and it would be right there.\\n\\n\\tIt wasn\\'t something that he\\'d written and forgotten about or whatever. So in a lot of ways, it sort of helped him be a little more accountable because it was just in his face. I could look at it and see and help him. I don\\'t know if he says he didn\\'t have something, I could see that he did and it wasn\\'t just something that he forgot he had, right? The negatives are definitely what you\\'re saying, as far as being distracted and like... It was hopeless. I tried so hard in the beginning to keep him off of video games. But for him, it was a total distraction, but somehow he was able to manage to keep up with schoolwork. I don\\'t know how he did it, but he definitely did his schoolwork, in addition to watching videos while the teacher was talking, which makes no sense.\\n\\n\\tIt would drive me batty, but the same thing. I\\'m trying to work and I can\\'t stay on top of him. I tried all the screen time things, but then he would just find ways around it. The greatest one was figuring out that he had to have Google Docs. So he figured out how he could import his YouTube videos into Google Doc and watch them, even though I turned off YouTube. One day, I\\'m like, \"How is he watching that?\" And he even told me, he was like, \"Oh!\" Like he was so proud, but I was like, \"That\\'s great that you figured it out, but it\\'s-\" [crosstalk 00:25:52]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s clever.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSo, besides that, I\\'m thinking... I mean, I think previous to this, he leaned towards the...\\n\\nPART 1 OF 4 ENDS [00:26:04]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI mean, I think previous to this, he leaned towards being really hyper-focused on video games. But it was a little more manageable because we could draw the line. He didn\\'t need the computer or the iPad to do something, so we could take it away. But like you\\'re saying, the school, it\\'s how he socialized, how he did all of his schoolwork. So it was a little hard to sort of... But part of me realizes it\\'s his personality. So, in general, it\\'s something that we have to work on anyway because there\\'s always going to be the temptation of electronic. I mean, as adults, we still have to learn how to turn off all the other distractions and do our work, so.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI mean his school, they made us feel better because they\\'re like, \"We\\'re dealing with all the kids.\" So it\\'s like, well, they\\'re well aware. So in a lot of ways, they changed some of their strategies to make things a little more interactive instead of a little less, sort of cut and dry, so they can engage them more, which helped somewhat, but.\\n\\n\\tAnyways, so my daughter, I don\\'t know, she\\'s totally addicted to her device, which she didn\\'t... Well, we had a family iPad before, but then once this happened, she\\'s 10, almost 11. So we eventually... She has her own device so that she could do the school stuff and she\\'s addicted to it. But it\\'s been a little tricky for her because she\\'s definitely become... It\\'s hard to motivate her to do other things because it\\'s like... So the gratification is there. It\\'s so easy. I don\\'t know. I feel like that\\'s the hardest part is how do you scale back, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nShe went back to school. And there\\'s not the excuse now. Her work isn\\'t on the device, so.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI don\\'t know, but it\\'s been definitely hard to reel it in a little.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that\\'s actually going to be my next question. It\\'s just about returning back and different challenges that we\\'re anticipating. But I just want to check in with Parent 3. Any progress? Are you able to speak now for a minute? Or is your audio able to be turned on? Okay, so we\\'ll move on, but if you figure out your audio, please speak up at any point.\\n\\n\\tSo, okay. So moving on to the next question, which is, as we have already started going back to school or planning to return to school, what challenges do you anticipate for your children returning to school? And are there any parts that you would maybe want to see continue or things that you would definitely want to see disappear? So anyone can take that one first.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSorry. Can you repeat that?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo yeah, just as we\\'re going back, what challenges do you anticipate your children facing? And is there anything that you\\'d like to see stay or go away?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWell, since I\\'m already muting, I think that going forward, it\\'s never, it\\'s not going to ever be the same the way it was. We\\'re in for the whole new life, basically. And I think that I\\'m not ever going to get my iPad back. That\\'s gone, so that\\'s a bummer. And I think that I\\'m going to see what I saw at the very end of the year when they went back. And I think I\\'m going to see that in the fall, meaning towards the end of the year, my son was failing out of school. And it was because I don\\'t think anybody was monitoring him. At least when he was home, I was monitoring him a little bit. Enough to be like, \"Did you do this? Did you do that?\"\\n\\n\\tWell, I\\'m not a helicopter parent anyway, but I\\'m certainly not... I\\'m thinking that he\\'s got special ed teachers who keep him on track and make them write down what he needs to do at the end of every day. But I found out that he was missing entire homeworks, entire reports, and when I would ask him, he would, \"Oh yeah, no, I turned everything in. Everything\\'s totally fine.\" And then I get an email from the school saying, \"He\\'s got an F,\" Or \"He\\'s got a D.\" He\\'s missing these six things. And so I anticipate it\\'s going to be very similar to that.\\n\\n\\tAs Parent 2 mentioned with the dyslexia, my son also has dyslexia. He was just diagnosed, though. And it\\'s not the one where you flip the things. It\\'s a much more weird. I don\\'t know. Anyways, he\\'s doing the Wilson book programs. And so, and he has summer school because of it, because and he\\'s only on grade three, it\\'s really bad. And so, I mean, the guy can barely read, and even when he reads, he can\\'t comprehend. So I just feel like I\\'m already starting off with just a huge catch-up that is unrealistic. He\\'s not going to catch up. And so it\\'s going to take years to get there. And it\\'s going to take a lot of summer school, so.\\n\\n\\tI mean, and I think that I actually anticipate that he\\'s going to need outside help and not just tutors, but people who are specifically trained in where he has deficiencies, with the ADHD and the focusing and the reading comprehension, and really, because he has to unlearn the way he learned and then relearn it a different way with the Wilson, that I think that I\\'m just anticipating a shit show.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. No, I hear what you\\'re saying that it\\'s going... No, no, I hear what you\\'re saying, that things probably will be different going forward. And I think you\\'re right to highlight that, especially kids that do need specialized support, everyone\\'s going to struggle going back, but.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnother thing, everybody is going to struggle. It\\'s just our kids, who need a little bit more support, are going to have a very hard time. And not just, he\\'s going to get extra support through sports through the school, for sure, because I make sure it\\'s in his IEP. I fight for him, like nobody\\'s business. But he\\'s going to need even more outside support and including me, my husband, and that sort of thing.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you\\'re anticipating having to supplement outside of what [crosstalk 00:33:21] the school system.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAbsolutely, absolutely. I think I\\'m going to have to fight tooth and nail to get everything that he needs. And then I\\'m going to have to get a second job to pay for all of the tutoring he\\'s going to need, so. Yeah. That\\'s, I\\'m anticipating a [crosstalk 00:33:33].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI hear you. I hear you. All right. Thanks.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThe other thing is it\\'s going to be hard for everybody.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, No, [crosstalk 00:33:43] but I think it will affect different kids differently, so.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWell, I actually thought that they should repeat personally because I don\\'t think he learned anything. And I feel like we lost so much that I\\'m like, \"Why are we even moving them onto the grade that they didn\\'t even...?\" Let\\'s just redo it. Everybody redo it. And then that\\'s just-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI\\'ve heard that argument.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo anyway, Next.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, Parent 1. Parent 4?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. So I don\\'t know, I think that there were some good things, like with the Google classroom and stuff, I could, not that I did, but because he gets very upset if I try to stay on top of him. He was able to see what he was missing and everything. And so I think going back, I think that he has learned some executive skills that he didn\\'t have before, which is really good for somebody who\\'s 16 and theoretically will fly the coop in two years. I do think he has expressed the fact that he is looking forward to going back to school. Because he will not be allowed to play video games while he\\'s supposed to be listening to the teachers, so that\\'s a good thing. I do agree that he has not learned as much as he should have. And I think that the thing that I\\'m most worried about is his math because he\\'s supposed to go into pre-calculus next year, and I\\'m not sure he knows trigonometry or whatever he was supposed to learn this year. But we\\'ll deal with it, tutors, whatever if he gets into trouble.\\n\\n\\tI\\'m not sure that I would agree with leaving everybody back because I do think... For my daughter, she\\'s much more high functioning than my son. And she had a 99 average between her classes and went to school and got all her schoolwork done and never handed anything in late. And meanwhile, my son had 20 missing assignments the day before school ended, and somehow he got it down to six. So, I think my daughter, I think she actually benefited because she\\'s a seventh-grade girl and seventh-grade girls are so mean to each other and the fact that they were at home and did not have to interact with all the other mean girls. I think that was actually good for her. So-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that\\'s interesting. We\\'ve heard that, that some of the social pressure was lessened. And they didn\\'t have to deal with the social drama as much and could focus on their work a little bit. So have you felt that was true for your daughter?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. And for my son too. I mean, my son was, I guess, I don\\'t know how much, whatever\\'s on, confidential. But the day before COVID hit, he was suspended for substance abuse in the school. And then he didn\\'t have to do his suspension. Because they were like, \"No, don\\'t come in.\" Because I\\'m a health care worker, and they\\'re like, \"No, no, she\\'s been exposed to COVID.\" So COVID was amazing because he was not allowed to interact with anybody for the first six months. And so he sort of was forced to deal with the substance abuse stuff and didn\\'t have access to it and all that, so that [crosstalk 00:37:34] was good. And now, I\\'m really worried about him going back because all those things are going to be there again. The social pressures and all that stuff.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. And yeah, those are things that they haven\\'t dealt with and maybe don\\'t necessarily have the skills and the coping skills, and it\\'s going to be a relearning process for how to deal with those pressures, but okay. Thank you. And yeah, no, it\\'s interesting to hear that he does also kind of want to go back to and recognize it that it has been distracting for him. And let me think, Parent 4, Administrator, were you going to ask the question before?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah, I was. And this is a question for everybody. We\\'ve heard a lot of parents talk about the pros and cons of the ways in which their children\\'s teachers have managed their kid\\'s specific needs, how Google classroom plays a role. How discord, how these other online resources affect that. So I just wanted to know, from you guys\\' perspective, how your specific teachers have either contributed or aided in the problems that your kids have dealt with throughout the pandemic and online technology in-school use and things like that.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOne thing I would say sort of to add to both of these things is my daughter\\'s 10, and she\\'s in fifth grade. So one negative thing that I saw that her teacher actually helped with a little was I think it was a lot for them to have to stare at themselves on the screen all the time. My daughter started, I don\\'t know, worrying about things about herself, like \"My eyebrows are too... You can\\'t see my...\", all these crazy things. And it\\'s because she\\'s looking at all of her friends and herself straight on all the time. So it did become sort of a conversation with her teacher. And they were pretty strict at first about trying to get them to turn all their cameras on.\\n\\n\\tBut I think they became a little more lenient when they sort of realized that kids can have their camera off but still be paying attention, which is the case with my daughter, probably not my son. But my daughter definitely, she would be doing what she needed to do most of the time. But so I do think it kind of, I don\\'t know, it was this weird... She became a little more self-conscious, I think, I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\tBut then it was interesting also to see the difference between my daughter\\'s teachers and my son\\'s teachers. He had way more daily, all the time classes in-person on Zoom. Whereas my daughter was a little more... She did have in-person, but it was, I don\\'t know, half the amount of time as him probably. So I don\\'t know. She had to work more independently than he did. I don\\'t know.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI have to step away for one moment. That\\'s a good point, and Administrator, maybe you could just continue with this. [inaudible 00:41:12].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'ll go. So I think that the teachers... It really depended on the type of teacher. The general ed teachers, I found, were less tolerant of any adjustments to the technology or to the timeframes of things. And they were just less flexible. And I think it\\'s because they were just overwhelmed with so many kids, plus so many kids with technology issues. And my boys didn\\'t have the same experience because I don\\'t have a girl. But I really, if I had been her, I would have been like, \"Oh my God, oh my God.\" I would have been like, \"Whoa, this is not good. Everybody\\'s seeing me.\" I would have flipped, so. But my kids are like, \"I have to shower, what?\" So I think that the general ed teachers were... I found some of them to be mean and just intolerant to any adjustments.\\n\\n\\tAnd, but then the special ed teachers would come in and say, \"Okay, let\\'s deal with this.\" And much the way they do at the actual school in-person. And so, I felt that they really helped facilitate the situation. And also act as a go-between in between me, the general ed teacher, and [inaudible 00:42:49] and my kids, both of them really. And so, I think that because they had two teachers, that really helped a lot. But also, I would find they would just disappear. We would log into school, and they would be like, \"So-and-so is out.\" Okay. And they would be out for one day. \"So here\\'s an assignment. We\\'re not going to give you any instructions.\" Or \"We don\\'t have a teacher for you because we don\\'t have subs. So go do it.\"\\n\\n\\tAnd that was very hard for them to understand that. And then you had also the ones who were like, \"Well, I\\'m out for whatever,\" or \"I\\'m sick.\" A lot of them did get sick, so they were out for a month. And so, in that case, if they had two teachers, the other one picked up the slack. But it was mostly just one day here, one day there, where it wasn\\'t anticipated. And so the kids were just sort of left hanging. And it was tough because they were like, \"Well, how do we do attendance if she\\'s not there? Or he\\'s not there?\" And it was just, Anyway, I think the teachers were frustrated, and that showed, that came through very much so. And honestly, they should have been frustrated. It was frustrating for everybody. So, that\\'s it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Parent 1. Any other, so Administrator, did we get some answers on that-\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n... question?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAbout teachers?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI mean, so my kids have a lot of teachers because they\\'re in high school and middle school. So, there was definitely a wide range of responses. Some teachers handled things really well. And I have to say that at my son\\'s school, they were very lenient about handing in assignments late. And my daughter\\'s school. They were also trying to focus on sort of the kids who were not handing in assignments, which I thought was really nice of them.\\n\\n\\tSo, but there were definitely, there were some teachers who showed up every day and wanted the cameras on. I mean, I guess they all showed up every day, but there was definitely some people who allowed the kids... Like Parent 4, Child 1 would, sorry, my son would lay in bed for his first, for the morning of classes. And some of the teachers were like, \"Fine. He\\'s in bed.\" But some of the teachers were like, \"No, he has to sit up, and we have to see him sit up.\" Because he would fall back to sleep during some of the classes, so. But I think the teachers were all... But my kids go to these really progressive schools in the city. So I think that that had something to do with the fact that the teachers were very lenient and forgiving of all the craziness that was happening.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. The school can make a big difference. Okay. So, Parent 2, I think we did want to hear from you a little bit. Do you have anything to say about any challenges you\\'re anticipating in going back and returning to being fully in-person?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI think as far as challenges, I think it\\'s more social. Right now, it\\'s hard to get my kids to... I don\\'t know. They feel like they\\'ve become hermits in some ways. So it is hard for me to get them to think outside of their video game box. You could give them a list of things to do and they can\\'t. I don\\'t know, they don\\'t seem to want to do anything, so I think that\\'s going to be the challenge. I mean, just really social, I think.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So I think the last question we\\'ll discuss is just diving a little bit deeper into gaming usage in particular because I\\'m hearing from you that you all felt like that was a big issue. And do you feel like they\\'re addicted? So I guess if you guys could just speak a little bit more to that, about how you saw that change? And what do you anticipate in terms of their gaming usage going forward?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'ll go. I think, first of all, we need to remember that it\\'s not the \\'80s, and we\\'re in a totally different era with or without COVID. I think that they are online all the time. And talk to adults who are young, much younger than us, but still in their 20s and things. And that\\'s how they live. They\\'re constantly online, be it for work and for gaming. And in some cases, I think that\\'s just going to be the new norm, and it\\'s not all bad because some gaming will teach you strategy and it\\'s conflict resolution and all sorts of things. I mean, you can go one way or the other. In terms of the gaming, though. I think that I\\'m seeing that my youngest, my eight-year-old is much more addicted than he ever was.\\n\\n\\tBefore. Yes, he had my iPad. Yes, but I could easily take it away from him. Now, it\\'s almost like the Chromebooks became a gateway drug to this whole, like a video game addiction thing. And both of my kids are complete addicts, complete. If I take it away from them, they will go through absolute withdrawals, to the point where I\\'m like, \"Whoa, this is not an appropriate reaction to what\\'s going on.\" And the world is ending apparently, if I turn off the internet, so. And so I think that because it\\'s sort of the Chromebooks came in and they figured out how to use them, and the teachers taught them how to use them. Now they\\'ve got all these skills that they can use for good or evil. And so they\\'re using it for both.\\n\\n\\tAnd I do find my eight-year-old, who would never lie and sneak, sneaks the iPad, sneaks the video games. He still admits to it, but soon, he will not admit to it. And he will not say, \"Oh mom, last night I woke up, and I played the video.\" At some point, he\\'s going to start lying. My other one is I actually have to cut him off at the knees. I have to say, \"Everything\\'s being shut down in 10 minutes.\" Otherwise, he will be up until 3:00 AM, every single night playing, playing, playing. And so are all of his friends. That\\'s what I don\\'t understand. I\\'m like, \"Who are you playing with?\" And he\\'s like, \"All of my friends.\" And so they\\'re all. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on, but everybody is just constantly on video games.\\n\\n\\tAnd that\\'s how they interact socially. And we\\'re not into play dates yet anymore, or them getting together socially outside yet. Maybe it\\'s because everybody tends to have younger kids. So they don\\'t want to expose those who are vaccinated. I mean, those who are not vaccinated to anything, which I totally get. And so they still need that for socialization. So I\\'m stuck, I\\'m stuck between both. And I think it\\'s just going to get worse, and I think we just need to embrace it and try and figure out what they\\'re really getting out of it in a positive way and emphasize that.\\n\\n\\tAnd so, and I think there are a lot... I can\\'t think of all of them now, but I read an article that was just really, it was pro-gaming, and it was awesome. Because I was like, \"Oh, I never thought of that.\" The strategy and conflict resolution. And they had brothers who lived... Were really close, and then they moved far away from each other. But the one thing they had in common was video games, and they talk every day. That\\'s a good thing. And so I think there\\'s a lot of positives that people forget about. On the flip side, they need to be-\\n\\nPART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:52:04]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOn the flip side, they need to be able to control it. And it\\'s hard. It\\'s almost like... It\\'s not like drugs, cigarettes, or something like that, it\\'s like sugar or caffeine. You can\\'t avoid sugar. You have to have a little bit of it, but you got to be able to control it. So, we could look at it like, sugar can be a good thing, sometimes it makes things taste good, but there has to be a balance and a way of figuring that out. And so, I would love help from the school and from Child Mind Institute.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. We\\'re trying to gather some resources. I think you\\'re highlighting a really important point, that moderation is always much harder than that all or nothing. And I appreciate your point about that, but here is a certain element of it that we have to embrace, because it is a new way of the world, and it is a nice attitude to try to embrace the positive parts of it that emphasize those parts, while still trying to teach those skills for how to regulate and stepping in where we need to. But that was well said, thank you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWe\\'ve had a lot of the same thing, but a few things. I sort of have a specific time, like the internet goes off. That way, it takes me out of it. Like they know, and then, I mean, they will ask for me to turn it back on or whatever, but it\\'s like, I don\\'t know. Because if it were up to me, I would forget, and it would be much later. So, that kind of helps a lot. The thing with my kids are, the different things they\\'re doing, lots of things are positive, Minecraft, all those things, but the most annoying thing are the YouTube videos of craziness that just keep going and going. It\\'s just such a mind numbing time-suck that my daughter gets into. I mean, so it really depends on what they\\'re doing, but it\\'s also difficult to always know what they\\'re doing, because they know how to get around everything.\\n\\n\\tSo, I don\\'t know, but the other positive thing is, my kids have definitely been playing games and things with their cousins who live on the west coast, in upstate New York, and their friends have become friends with their cousins on these. So, their circle is bigger and more connected through these. So, it\\'s really, really sweet to my daughter. Now, her cousin knows her best friend and it\\'s not just this person that exists. So, that\\'s good, but it\\'s definitely trying to do it in moderation and to be able take a break and do other things and be engaged in the conversation around you and not need it every second. Every break in the day doesn\\'t have to be video games, but I don\\'t know, it\\'s a battle.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, definitely. But yeah. Now, you highlighted some nice positives also, and yeah, I think it\\'s kind of a new frontier for everyone. Parent 4 Did you have any?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nNo, I mean, I think my son was way addicted before COVID and is still as addicted to video gaming as he was before.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHave you noticed it get worse or it\\'s just the fact that it\\'s impacting his academics somehow?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t. It\\'s sort of always impacted his academics. So, yeah, he\\'s had a problem with it for a while. I think one thing that I actually wanted to say that I didn\\'t bring up before about the social thing, my son actually had a girlfriend all from COVID. So, they\\'ve been together for the past 17 months or something. And for a while, they were like their own pod, and he went to her lake house and she would spend time with us. And now that things are opening up, he wants to spend time with his friends and she wants to spend time with her friends. And so, they\\'re having these issues that they haven\\'t had for the past 17 months with things that girlfriends and boyfriends probably should have learned how to navigate by this point in their relationship. So, I know that has nothing to do with video gaming, but I wanted to say it before, but I forgot.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that\\'s definitely a challenge that I think a lot of adults are facing. And yeah, that\\'s something that we would want to represent also. So, I think we have a couple more minutes. Anyone have any last thoughts of anything related to technologies over the pandemic that we didn\\'t bring up?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI just have a suggestion for everybody. My eight year old, he\\'s like a walking encyclopedia, and it\\'s because he\\'s been watching these YouTube videos and I... I got to fly around me, sorry. This is driving me crazy. And it\\'s called, he has learned so much and he can regurgitate it on the fly, because it\\'s called over-simplified. And it\\'s these little tiny clips of just oversimplified history, oversimplified explanations about things. And he introduced it to us. He\\'s eight years old. My 13 year old and I both like it and I learn stuff from it. I\\'m like, \"Wow, I\\'m a history major, no, I remember that\". But my explanation was dragged out and their eyes rolled into the back of heads in history class. But this oversimplified, you should guys should check it out. It\\'s really cool.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI\\'m sure I can learn from it too. That sounds really cool. Anyone else have any tips or anything else to share? Okay. So, thank you so much for taking time to do this with us. We\\'ve, we\\'ve learned a lot through these focus groups and this was a great group, and it really does help us understand what people are going through. So, thank you so much, and you\\'ll obviously be invited to the Town Hall when we have it. And we hope to present some of the findings.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWhen will we have the tips and suggestions on how to handle all this out?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSo, we have one more group, and then once we\\'re done with all of our focus groups, we\\'ve been in talks since about April or May about different resources that CMI can provide to you all, just based on the information that we\\'ve collected. Like Moderator 1 said, everything that you guys have said is very consistent with everything that we\\'ve been hearing over the past couple of months. So, we\\'re figuring out like what resources we can provide you guys with. I\\'m not sure on like a hard date when the Town Hall will happen, but it will happen definitely before the end of Summer. So, I will definitely be in contact with you guys once that date is scheduled. If there are any questions or concerns or anything that, any things that you would want us to potentially cover in a Town Hall, any resources that like might be valuable to you guys, definitely let us know.\\n\\n\\tJust like I said, one, because information is consistent, but two, we want to also ensure that based on the wide range of kids ages that we see who have different needs, that we\\'re trying to like really target everybody and meet them where they\\'re at.\\n\\n\\tSo, I guess it\\'s me now, I\\'ll clean up. Hi Moderator 1. So, yes. Once again, thank you guys so much for participating in our focus group today. I\\'m going to be sending our administrator your emails, so that way you guys can receive the $50 Amazon gift card. If you do not receive it by Friday, please do not hesitate to either email me or give me a call and we will sort that out. But once again, thank you guys so much for all of your help today, and I will definitely contact you guys in a few. Just let you guys know more about next steps and things like that at the Town Hall.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you everyone. So nice to meet you.\\n\\nSpeaker 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you guys. Have a good day.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nPART 3 OF 4 ENDS [01:18:04]\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\n(silence).\\n\\n\\tAs you can see, he\\'s not used to going to the office.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:27:05], but it was like a year prior to the (silence).\\n\\nPART 4 OF 4 ENDS [01:41:18]'b'Moderator 1:\\n\\n(silence). Hi, Parent 1. Welcome to the webinar.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks so much for joining. We\\'ll wait for the other members to sign on.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, I was just having technical difficulties, so I thought I\\'d try early.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI appreciate that.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYou know how [inaudible 00:01:26], and it\\'s very...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI appreciate that. No, that\\'s definitely appreciated, to try a few minutes before. So, we\\'ll just wait for everyone else to sign on.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSure. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI guess there\\'s some CP. Let me come and support. The other person is on a speaker. The other person may tell us about how we can explain that chance. I thought you add up to 100, with what you had earlier.. And to have them in large, yeah. Let\\'s finish this out here. Oh, damn. Oops, it\\'s the chance in Spanish. Just put it there. Yes. Oh. Yeah, it\\'s there. Let me just disappear.  \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 2. Welcome.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi, thanks. I\\'m just looking for my-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks for signing on. And we\\'ll all just wait for another few minutes for the rest of the group.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAll right. I\\'m going to just grab a notebook in the other room.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, take your time.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWelcome to chat. (silence). This is the elders. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 2. Welcome.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi. Thanks\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWere just going to wait another few minutes for the rest of the group, but we should get started soon.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNo problem. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s still the same. Let\\'s finish. Finish. Okay. (silence).\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo, you\\'re all welcome. Thanks for joining. We\\'ll get started in a few minutes. Hi, Administrator?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi. So sorry I\\'m running late. I\\'m just going to check one quick thing. I think everybody is here. So, we\\'re just missing one person.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. I guess lets just wait one minute, and then we could get started, because we\\'re going to do some introductions, first, anyway. \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nDefinitely \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Okay, we can get started. First of all, thank you everyone for joining us today. We really appreciate you setting aside some time to do this focus group. The purpose of this focus group is just to learn a little bit more about specific aspects of your experience during COVID. I know you all had filled out our questionnaire, so we wanted this to just be a little bit more of an open-ended discussion. \\n\\n\\tThere\\'s one important point I want to emphasize at the outset, is that we really do want to try to understand each person\\'s individual experience. And I think from what we\\'ve seen, there\\'s a lot of aspects of the experiences that overlap, but then also everyone\\'s having their own unique experience. So, please feel free to say, \"Yes, that\\'s exactly what I\\'ve been experiencing.\" Or tell us your unique experience, and how that might a bit differ from something that someone else said.\\n\\n\\tBefore we get started, I was hoping we could just go around and introduce ourselves, and do a fun ice breaker. So, what I was thinking is maybe we could all just say our names, the ages of your kid or kids. And then say the best movie or TV show you\\'ve seen over the past year. And then maybe we can also walk away with some recommendations of things to watch.\\n\\n\\tSo, I\\'ll go first. My name is Moderator 1. I am a psychologist and a neuropsychologist. I\\'m the clinical training and assessment manager of the Harlem team of the Healthy Brain Network. I do not have any kids. And the best thing I\\'ve probably watched over the past year... I know I\\'m late to this, but I started watching the show Ozark, and I thought it was excellent. If you like intense thriller suspense drama, then I highly recommend.\\n\\n\\tHi, Parent 3. Thank you so much for joining. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWe were just going around and doing some introductions and a quick ice breaker. We were just saying we would go around say our names, the ages of your kids. And if you have something to recommend to watch on TV or a movie that you\\'ve seen over the past year. Who wants to go next? Parent 2? Okay. You can take yourself off mute.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi. My name is Parent 2. I have three girls. I have a 12 year old, and twins that are nine. Which show did I like? I finished watching Breaking Bad early. I guess I\\'m probably late to the game on that one, but I love that. That was great. Also, The Americans, which was on FX, I binge watched that in the beginning. I love that one too.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah, I\\'m a big Americans fan also. Thanks, Parent 2. Who\\'s next? Parent 4? Oh yeah.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nDid you say Parent 4?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, Parent 4, go ahead.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOkay. I\\'m Parent 4. I have two daughters, Child 1, who is almost 12, and she did a study with the Healthy Brain Network, and my daughter, Parent 4, Child 2, who is seven. And let me see, the best... Well, unlike some of you, these incredibly intense shows, I have not been able to watch in the past year. I can\\'t handle that much stress. And so, what I really enjoyed was Ted Lasso, on Apple Plus TV, because it\\'s friendly. It\\'s warm, it\\'s easy, it\\'s funny. And I said, \"Thank you, that\\'s what I need.\" And I\\'m really enjoying that now.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI hear that. I hear that. I hear not being in the mood for something intense. Now I\\'ve added some Ted Lasso. Okay, Parent 1, you want to go next?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSure. I\\'m Parent 1. We have a only son, who just turned 15 on Friday. And we\\'ve instituted, during this time, a Saturday family movie night, which is hard to hit all of our things, but my son\\'s into music, so we watched A Hard Day\\'s Night, and enjoyed that. The Beetles.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nCara, do you want to go next?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, oh, just that she probably lost sound for a second.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Parent 5. I have eight year old boy/girl twins. I\\'ve been stuck on the question as I teach film studies classes, so I\\'m always watching stuff. I stuck in this whirlpool of like, \"What was the best thing I watched?\" It probably doesn\\'t matter, but I really enjoyed watching Kim\\'s Convenience, which was not for work, on some TV show. So...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s so funny. I just started that show last week. I\\'m loving it. It\\'s so endearing. It\\'s adorable. It\\'s a good one if you\\'re in the mood for something lighter, Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi. I have two kids, a 12 year old and a nine year old. Nine year old that studied with you guys. The shows that I recently watched, yeah, I stayed away from any intense, stressful stuff, but the only intense, stressful stuff I might watch, still, because I follow it, are NCIS and FBI. Other than that, we stick to the really stupid stuff like adults; cartoons, and things like that.\\n\\n\\tBut my kids actually got hooked on the NCIS and the FBI, and now they walk around throwing around acronyms that are used there, and they found lots of tough stuff, but opportune there. It\\'s a good... You know? Then, we do, just like someone else mentioned, I think Parent 1, we do, also, movie nights.\\n\\n\\tAnd so, we\\'ll pick something from the good old days, of like \\'80s, or early \\'90s, which tend to be a little bit more easygoing. They like Mr. Bean, so we\\'ll do some of those. We\\'ve revisited goodies, all these bad goodies, and that\\'s been working for us. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry. That sounds fun. Thank you, Parent 3. Then, I see there\\'s someone else on the call. Administrator, I don\\'t know if that\\'s you also just calling in from your phone?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThat\\'s my phone.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh, that\\'s your phone? Okay.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThat\\'s my phone, because it might-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you\\'re that extra voice that\\'s coming through? Okay.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah. Yeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThen, maybe let\\'s see-\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nMy computer won\\'t play the sound so I have to call in.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGot you. Okay, that works. I was wondering how we were hearing you with the mute on, so that totally makes sense now. Okay. All right. \\n\\n\\tIn order to just start the discussion, what I\\'d like to do for the next couple minutes is, if everyone has a paper and pencil handy, try to write down the two or three best ways that technology has impacted you since COVID started.\\n\\n\\tThen, also, two or three negative ways that technology has impacted you since COVID started. So, let\\'s take a couple of minutes to do that, just to put our thoughts together. (silence). Okay, let\\'s take one more minute and then we\\'ll talk about it. (silence).\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve finished writing down two or three ways, the best ways that technology has impacted you, and two or three negative ways that technology has impacted you, I\\'d like you to think which side has had the more significant net impact.\\n\\n\\tWould you say that the good group has had the biggest overall impact, or the bad group has had the biggest overall impact? And just circle whichever one that is, whether it\\'s the good group or the bad group, that\\'s had a bigger impact. (silence).\\n\\n\\tOkay. So, by a show of hands, how many people felt that the positive parts of technology have had a bigger impact over the past year and a half? Parent 2, you feel like the positive outweighs. How many of you guys felt that the negative outweighed the positive over the past... Okay. And then Parent 4, you\\'re in the middle, is it breaking even for you?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWell, the thing is, for me, the positives were a necessity. I didn\\'t lose my job because I was able to use technology. My kids still had learning, because we have technology. But the screen addiction that has occurred because of this is such an overwhelming emotional burden that has so crippled me and my family, that I can\\'t say that it\\'s better. So, I don\\'t know how you weigh the two, so that is why I couldn\\'t really respond.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI hear that, because the positives are so necessary and have enabled the function, so you can underplay them. Bit it sounds like it\\'s had a real overall negative crippling impact.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI think so. I think so. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy kids have forgotten how to do anything without the computer. It\\'s just absurd.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. One question that I want to put out to the group, and we\\'re going to touch on some of the positives and negatives that you wrote down, I\\'d like to hear a little bit about how everyone used technology for school before the pandemic. So, how did people feel about technology for educational purposes before? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns before the pandemic? So, I\\'ll let anyone answer.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI can go.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, Parent 5.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, I didn\\'t use technology for education at home with my kids. I left it up to the school. I mean, I trusted the school. I knew that they had computer class, and I do think that\\'s important, but I left it up to them. And for me, we used it almost exclusively for entertainment. Like when I needed to get something done, like make dinner, or something, and I just needed them occupied, that was it.\\n\\n\\tI mean, some of that context, I think, matters, because I\\'m a single parent and we lived in an apartment in Brooklyn. So, the option of saying, \"Go outside and play,\" isn\\'t there. If I have to be inside doing something, they have to be inside with me. And that\\'s changed too, because we\\'ve moved since then. I mean, very rarely I would use maybe YouTube, or something, to show them something that they asked about, that I couldn\\'t just answer in words. But I didn\\'t use it much for education, so...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s interesting. So it didn\\'t play such a big role educationally. Anyone else, what have your experiences been with technology before... Yeah, Parent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nFor us, similar to Parent 5\\'s situation, we really, before the pandemic, we were very strict about screen time. The kids only used the computers at school. I mean, if they had to, they\\'d use them at home, but it was mostly unnecessary. They didn\\'t really have phones. Again, it was unnecessary. They knew how to use them, but it was just an arbitrary thing, because they would use them in school and it was sufficient. \\n\\n\\tAnd so, obviously, during the pandemic, they had a steep learning curve, and they went from like 10% of knowledge to 200% of knowledge. I\\'ve tried blocking some apps from them and websites, and they actually figure out a way around. So, even though it\\'s blocked, they can still somehow manage to get around it. Yeah, it\\'s become from none relevant education to solely relying on it for education, entertainment, and keeping them quiet. Yeah. That\\'s it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right. So, for both of you, Parent 3 and Parent 5, it sounds like it\\'s been a very big switch, because they didn\\'t really use technology so much before?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nMine came because I can\\'t keep them out of the parts I really don\\'t want them in. The school gives them Chromebooks that I have no administrative control over, so I can\\'t. Even if I did have control, there\\'s still problems. It\\'s difficult. But if I wanted them to only use educational programs, I\\'d have to sit next to them the whole time to make sure they didn\\'t leave and do something else.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Parent 4, Parent 2, Parent 1, what were your experiences with technology for educational purposes before the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay... Oh, go ahead.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nBeforehand, my seven year old didn\\'t use a computer at all. And I was delighted, because I read that the American Academy of Pediatrics said no screen time for children under the age of 10. And so, I stood by that. She had zero screen time. For my then 11 year old... 10 year old, oh god, when she had to, she would use the computer for typing and handing in assignments sometimes, because they did start using Google Classroom, I think, at least to print things out, I think. So she had started using computer.\\n\\n\\tAnd for research, I will say it was nice. Because I remember, when I was in school, having like a 15 year old encyclopedia, and it just didn\\'t have half the things I needed. And suddenly having the internet meant they could really get the information they needed. So that, actually, was very nice for that. However, it opens such a can of worms, that it\\'s a struggle. But it\\'s still, as with the other ladies, the difference has just been like getting hit by a tsunami. Suddenly, everything is on the computer. So...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Parent 2, what have your experiences been?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah. Similar to Parent 5 and Parent 3, I mean, my kids would borrow my phone. They didn\\'t have a Chromebook or iPad before this all happened. They got the Chromebooks from school. I mean, I\\'m working from home. I have three kids to juggle. I have conference calls, keep them quiet. So I got them all iPads and roadblocks happened, and that\\'s how they communicate with friends. And it went all downhill, and now it\\'s this huge thing that I can\\'t... They\\'re so addicted. \\n\\n\\tThey run home from school, \"Where\\'s my iPad? I want to play.\" And now it\\'s, I\\'m still working. And then you give it to them for a little bit, and they just don\\'t want to get off. I mean, we really... They would play games or... For school, it was very minimal to start. Then, once we were home and they had these Chromebooks, they knew, like Parent 3 said, they knew how to get around things. They can get into games, and things you don\\'t want them on. Yeah, it\\'s like a lost battle.\\n\\n\\tI wanted to clarify, when I said that the technology, I felt it was better, I guess I was referring to me, for my job. Like, \"Oh, man, I\\'ve always wanted to work from home.\" So, it\\'s been a great thing that I can be at home. And it\\'s a lot better now that they\\'re back in school. But for the kids, I mean, it\\'s just, it\\'s too much for them. Way too much.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right. You were referring to a net positive for your family, and for you. Which is, we\\'re trying to understand that also. The good comes with the bad, it sounds like. Parent 1, what was your family\\'s experience with using technology for educational purposes before? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, he was in the beginning of eighth grade, and then pandemic started second semester, or whatever, eighth grade. We used to just rarely, rarely, at home... He would be on the computer at school, definitely. They did group projects and research, so he was learning how to research on the computer.\\n\\n\\tI mean, we would mostly look up like, what is that math concept? And what do we know it as? Or something to help him figure out what is this, something like that. But that was about the size of it. He already was on games, and talking to his friends through the games, video games, before the pandemic. And now it\\'s 24/7, you know?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So, yeah, there is also-\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd a distraction during school, and you never know what he\\'s on. He\\'s just in front of a screen. Yeah. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. It seems like I\\'m hearing a little bit of a difference between younger and older kids, and how exposed they were to technology before. Let\\'s shift, now, into now that technology was being used more for school purposes, during the pandemic, did you find it beneficial for educational purposes? I know, Parent 4, you mentioned for the research part. Concerns, problems, as it relates to using it for educational purposes.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI can answer that-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, go ahead.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\n... if it\\'s fine. For us, it\\'s actually, as much as it has become a headache, because my son is dyslexic and has ADHD, it has been easier for him to do schoolwork. Because now he can speak and it types for him, or he can just type. He\\'s gotten much better at spelling, because he sees the words pop up, it does auto correct. He remembers how they\\'re spelled. So, he has improved in that sense. It has been really, really helpful. When he wants to read something, it reads it to him. So, that\\'s been a great improvement, in that sense. Having said-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt sounds like for that assistive technology piece, it\\'s been really helpful. Can you just go back and speak a little bit more? You said that because of the ADHD, that it\\'s been helpful in terms of that. Can you expand on that a little? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOh, well, with the HD, no, I don\\'t know as much as it\\'s been helpful with ADHD. I feel like that\\'s actually been worse, because he\\'s not able to focus as much, because he\\'s removed from the classroom. He\\'s currently still 100% remote. So, I think it\\'s harder for him to relate to his peers and teachers, because they\\'re just a face on the screen. \\n\\n\\tADHD, I feel like has gotten worse, but dyslexia has gotten better. Not that it\\'s gotten better, but he\\'s able to manage it better, having those access to that technology. It\\'s been sort of a trade off and, and we\\'re still figuring out how to manage that. Because when he wants help, then he\\'s like, it\\'s hard to pull him away from the computer. So, he tends to be now overstimulated, dysregulated. \\n\\n\\tAnd so, we\\'re talking about, that\\'s great, he moved up three reading levels, but he\\'s bouncing off the wall. So, how do you manage that? It\\'s a trade-off, but it\\'s still, I feel like it\\'s been helpful for his self-esteem, to be able to keep up with the class. It\\'s still hard for him, but at least, in the dyslexia realm, he\\'s at least able to do things faster. And so, I think he feels better about himself.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s really interesting. Yeah, Parent 5, do you have something here?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI just wanted to respond off of Parent 3\\'s comment, because my son also has ADHD, but differently, he has anxiety and ODD as well. So, the online learning was a complete disaster for him. I\\'ve actually done it with two separate schools, because we were in Brooklyn, in the spring, and we\\'ve moved to North Carolina. So, it\\'s not even just one school, it\\'s the computer, that\\'s the big issue, or the tablet. \\n\\n\\tBut he can\\'t focus on live or asynchronous activities on the computer because of the other options available. I mean, I do think, in theory, if you had a single... Or you had some kind of computer device that the teacher controlled, that did not have any freedom for the student to change what you could look at, it could work, maybe, but it doesn\\'t. It doesn\\'t have that. He just clicks around and does anything except what he\\'s supposed to be looking at. Parent 5, Child 2, I need you to leave right now, because you\\'re making too much noise. Out.\\n\\nParent 5, Child 2:\\n\\nCan I have a pencil?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nNo, out. Out. Find a pencil out there. But he also would get up and walk away in the middle of things. He had no problem lying to me. He\\'d tell me, \"Oh yeah, class is done. I signed out of the meeting because it was over.\" \\n\\n\\tIn one school, they had a pair of call to try to work with him one-on-one on the phone. Which was terrible because she had a cell phone with a bad connection, so it was difficult, but he would hang up on her constantly. It was so rude, but she would call me and say, \"He hung up on me.\"\\n\\n\\tAnd then the second school, they did nothing, absolutely nothing to take his IEP and translate it to online. They just said, \"We can\\'t. There\\'s nothing we can do.\" And it\\'s been extremely frustrating. So, he\\'s falling behind, way behind, in terms of where he was. I don\\'t know that he\\'s lost learning, but he hasn\\'t been making progress. And it is, he needs to be in-person.\\n\\n\\tNow, they returned to in-person four days a week, but they have not stopped using those computers. They sit at their desk, six feet apart, and every activity is computer-based, except recess and lunch. Surprise, those are his favorite subjects now. I mean, I think there\\'s a tendency that they always would be. So, maybe it\\'s not the technology part. \\n\\n\\tAnd it is a shame, because the computer, a screen can be a great learning tool. Like Parent 4 was saying, at their old school, before the pandemic, the kindergarten has had a research project, which the parents helped out with. And I was one of them. The kids were going to get a fish tank, and each kid chose a fish they wanted to research. So, that\\'s what I did. \\n\\n\\tI sat next to them at the computer and said, \"What\\'s your fish?\" And we found a picture of it together on the computer, to print it out. And then we looked up information. Then they had to find out how big is the fish. And we cut a string, and then they click it over to the fish tank to see if it would fit in their fish tank. And that was an amazing use of the computer with adult assistance. And that\\'s not what we\\'re getting though, at this point. So, I\\'ll stop.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou brought up two interesting points that I\\'m interested to hear other people\\'s thoughts on. One, just that the kids need to be able to manage some of this on their own. There\\'s, likely, you have to rely on them reporting if they\\'re actually online, and they can just walk away. And then, also, some of the specialized support, or supportive services, in terms of an IEP, and that not getting adapted. So, I\\'m curious to hear, Parent 1, Parent 4, Parent 5, and whoever wants to chime in on those. Parent 1, do you want to...\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah. I mean, online learning has been a disaster at the end of eighth grade, and in ninth grade now, first year in high school, because he does better with people in the presence, in the classroom, that\\'s more motivating, it\\'s more engaging, does the same thing, just lying. You\\'re just constantly monitoring, trying to find out what the, \"Hey?\" Teachers acting like, \"You should be doing this. Or you should be letting them know.\" And it\\'s just a nightmare. It\\'s a nightmare.\\n\\n\\tAlso, with burgeoning independence, he used to walk to school from our house in Brooklyn, like it\\'s five blocks. But he\\'d go there and come home by himself, in eighth grade. And then this term, under the same roof with us 24/7, I mean, it\\'s horrible. He\\'s just started back two days and every other Friday a week. So, he\\'s taking the subway to Astoria, to high school. So that\\'s been helpful. But the same thing, they\\'re in the room with their laptop. \\n\\n\\tWhether you\\'re at home or you\\'re in the school, you\\'re being taught... There\\'s Roomies and Zoomies, and you\\'re all in the same class through the screen, through the screen, through the screen. So, it\\'s problematic. It\\'s very problematic. He is an IEP. He has ADD. He has counselors who call him up, but then they\\'ve offered other help and he just blows off this, or doesn\\'t return any email. Or you keep trying to positively engage him and reminding him of this, that and the other. It\\'s too much. He doesn\\'t follow through. I think he would get a lot more help at school, and be motivated and... You know?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. I never heard that term, Roomies and Zoomies.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWe\\'ll use it here, too.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4, anything to add-\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd he\\'s barely passing. He\\'s just barely passing.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry, what did you say, Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHe\\'s just barely passing. That\\'s what he needs, fronting it in, and, \"Oh, I got a 66.\" Great.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. The engagement isn\\'t really there?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nNo. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 2 or Parent 4, anything to add on that point? I mean-\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMy daughter, my oldest has ODD, she has some anxiety. So, yeah, learning at home, disaster. She went from fifth grade with one teacher for every subject, really smart kid. It was so easy. She put in the minimum, she got Bs. She did just fine. Now, terrible transition into middle school. Terrible. I mean, there\\'s like six different teachers. She\\'s got executive functioning. Disaster, with that.\\n\\n\\tShe\\'s no longer organized. It\\'s been a real challenge. We were able to... In September, they went back to school every other day. It was twice a week. And in March, we got her to start going to school every day, which has helped her get more into a routine. I have an IEP meeting set up for her on Friday, to gather extra help.\\n\\n\\tI mean, it\\'s still been a battle even with her back in school. She\\'s not getting the extra attention that she needs. It just, it\\'s been an awful transition. Maybe if your kid\\'s just like... How do you say it? Is normal, doesn\\'t have any extra needs, maybe it went okay. But I know for my daughter, it did not transition well.\\n\\n\\tAnd I do want to say for one of my younger daughter, she\\'s very anxious. She likes to stay close to me, always wants to know where I am, if I leave the house, where I\\'m going. So, being at home and doing school, she actually, she was my best one. She was not doing that great in school, but at home, she actually, she was on time for every meeting. She knew when to sign in and log in. I think she was just so much more comfortable being at home and I was there all the time. So, that was nice, see that in her. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. No, and that\\'s interesting to see how it affects different kids, different ways. And that it could have a positive impact, even though it seems like that\\'s not the norm.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWell, I would say that, yes, Thea is the same way. She would... And she does, and that\\'s my problem, but for her, she likes being at home. She\\'s an introvert. She\\'s perfectly happy to be here on her own, just looking at the computer. And so, last semester was difficult, but in the one trimester, but the one that just finished, she actually had the grades, were the best they\\'ve ever been. \\n\\n\\tShe doesn\\'t have the social issues. She just, she is dyslexic. So, for her to just be focused on this computer, it actually works well for her. And, of course, what I did, because of the whole roadblocks and all the other issues, I put so many restrictions on that computer. I used a springtime from the Apple. I bought Custodio, for her phone. \\n\\n\\tI bought so many restrictions that if she was going to be on the computer, what she wanted to do wasn\\'t a whole lot to do except schoolwork. So, what actually helped her in that sense. She actually did better. It makes me insane because she doesn\\'t get out of that chair. But in terms of the ocular work, I think it worked okay for her super. Some kids, it can work, I still don\\'t think it\\'s good for them. Even though she\\'s doing better, I still don\\'t think it\\'s good. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. All right. So, let\\'s move on to a different question. Now, it sounds like some people are still at home, some people have returned to being in person. But as we are in the future, going to return to being in person, I\\'d like to hear what parts of technology for school would you like to see continue? And what parts do you hope will end? If anyone want to take that one on first?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI will. I want it all to end.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, go for it, Shelley. Yeah. But you hope it will all end? Okay.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWe just close those computers and be done with it. The research for homework, okay, but everything else, I just want all on paper. I want it all written out. I mean, just the idea, they can\\'t even write their names anymore. I can\\'t write my name anymore because of computers. But I would just love to set it out the window. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI hear you, Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt can\\'t be good for your brains.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnyone else, are there any parts that you would like to see continue, or specific parts that you would hope would end? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI mean, I would say for us, like I mentioned before, as long as they can swipe up their homework, that\\'s definitely been helpful. But other than that, I agree there\\'s really no need, because they can take care of everything at school. So, for neatness\\' sake, they can type it up and print it out. That\\'s fine. Reports to research, I\\'m okay with that, but anything else I feel like it\\'s unnecessary. \\n\\n\\tAnd to speak to what Parent 5 and Parent 2 has said, my son also has ODD, and it has gotten worse as we\\'ve been home. Like I said, it\\'s been a weird thing with dyslexia improving with some of the things he\\'s managing, but all the other stuff is falling apart. So, if he were more attentive, I would send him to school. But he forgets, he loses his mask, puts his hand in his mouth. If he gets bored, he just starts jumping, rolling around. It\\'s not feasible for me to send him in now, as much as I would love him to have that in-person experience.\\n\\n\\tBut yeah, I definitely agree that the computers must go, at least at home. I don\\'t care what they do in school. They sometimes behave better in school. They\\'re more compliant, when they come home, they want to relax. So, it\\'s a little bit different. I would be perfectly happy to just keep it for bare, and then they can always catch up, because there\\'s computers everywhere. So, I don\\'t fear they\\'ll be falling behind in their knowledge and experience.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnyone have any different feelings about things they\\'d like to see stay or go? Parent 5?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI absolutely want these things out of my house, especially the school issued ones that I can\\'t institute control over. That really bugged me. I understood, in the sense that they didn\\'t want me also messing up their machine, but if I can\\'t keep my kid off inappropriate YouTube sites, then it\\'s not an appropriate tool.\\n\\n\\tHowever, I\\'m trying here to think about, how could you do it in a positive way? Because I feel obligated. Media studies is my thing. I\\'m not anti media studies, but I teach college students, I do not teach ignorance. There\\'s a big difference. But I think some of the problems with the online reading programs and mass problems, for me, well, there\\'s two things.\\n\\n\\tOne, I don\\'t think the kids get real feedback. Yes, the game tells you if you got the question right or wrong, but I don\\'t think it\\'s the same effect as a person that you haven\\'t had a relationship with, the teacher, expressing that, \"Wow, I\\'ve noticed that you\\'ve been improving.\" Or, \"I noticed you\\'re not doing as well today. Are you sleeping?\" Whatever it is, that kind of response feedback is really crucial, especially the younger they are, not just an instant little... The game fanfare and stuff is fine.\\n\\n\\tBut two is, as a parent, I have no idea what they\\'re doing when it\\'s online. You don\\'t get a print here. It\\'s not like getting the papers. And I got too much paper before this, then I would get home like, \"Oh my child wrote all these sentences.\" Or, \"These are their math worksheets. I can see what they\\'re doing, and what they\\'re struggling with. I can see their handwriting improving.\" I can\\'t see anything. And the teachers on the report cards, they don\\'t say much. Just, it\\'s like, \"Meet standards. Approaching standards.\" But what does that mean? I can\\'t see the material. \\n\\n\\tI mean, unless I don\\'t work and sit next to them all day and watch them doing it, which is incredibly boring on top of everything, on top of just not being possible. So, in theory, if there were some programs or a way of using that involved, both things, like some practice of the math online, but also some way of a parent viewing results quickly, like getting, I don\\'t know, a weekly snapshot of like, \"What did your child do? How many problems did they miss? Does it look like they\\'re walking away maybe because they\\'re not doing any of it?\" I mean, different way to get contact.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt sounds like it would be helpful to have some tangible feedback of progress, so you\\'re missing that. And then also maybe doing things through technology is just, people are giving more limited feedback and you\\'re missing that personalized touch.\\n\\n\\tI have one more question about the education piece, and then I want to just move in more into the gaming. Because I know I\\'m hearing a lot that gaming has been an issue for a bunch of you. \\n\\n\\tI know some of your kids are already back in school, but what challenges have you seen for returning to in-person school, or what challenges do you anticipate in returning to in-person school after whatever amount of time?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nKeep it short, but since we go back, we went back in January, in person, being backslide in social and emotional competence, and I saw it coming. Well, it didn\\'t take me by surprise, but returning to behaviors that we\\'d spent two years working on building a support system in school to prevent it from happening, and just that had eroded.\\n\\n\\tWhat I didn\\'t anticipate is that back in school that they\\'re really not still meeting their friends. We need to meet new friends, because it\\'s a new school. Even with recess, it\\'s still very slow. Maybe it\\'s because we were just separate from people for so long, but it\\'s a lot more difficult than it usually is for them to make friendship connections.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks, Parent 5. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m just surprised that my son started at a new school, different burrow, the kids talk on Instagram, and these are boys. I don\\'t know. And they would share information about a positive COVID test in school, or whatever. So, he felt he knew kids. And then he met some of them. March 22nd, we opted into cohort one, which is Monday and Tuesday, and every other Friday. \\n\\n\\tBut it\\'s a problem also, you have to carry your laptop into school. I just wonder, in New York City, so everyone knows that every kid out on the street has a laptop in their backpack. I\\'m just waiting for... Not to mention their phone. But it\\'s been positive for him, even going in and having the onscreen class, because he\\'s getting to know the building. It\\'s a new high school, I mean, for him, and he has met some kids. So, just finding his way around the building is the thing, and meeting kids in the flesh. So, it\\'s been a plus.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. And that\\'s the unique circumstance of actually going to a new school, when you\\'re returning. Anyone else have anything they want to add about you anticipating difficulty integrating back? Yeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nFor my middle schooler, when we were home, we were doing every other day. So, every other day she had to be at the school, at 7:15, but on her home days, there was no live instruction. So, she could sleep till whenever. And she\\'s getting to the point, like on the weekends, she loves to sleep later. She\\'s going to bed the same time, I\\'d let her sleep in. That was hard. It\\'s hard. It\\'s been hard to get her up every day, to be on a schedule. But other than that, I\\'m very happy that they\\'re back. Sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. No, it\\'s okay. So returning to a schedule was an adjustment, but-\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAny other challenges people anticipate in returning back, or that they see, and if you\\'ve already returned back?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI foresee that being an issue as well. Because, right now, they can wake up five minutes before their class. They can brush their teeth in between breaks, or between classes rather. Like they can eat in front of the screen. They don\\'t have to worry so much about their outfit, and being comfortable. They can lay in bed when they\\'re in class, it\\'s fine.\\n\\n\\tOnce they start school, they can\\'t do any of that. And my oldest actually expressed that to me. She said, \"I\\'m concerned.\" Because she started sixth grade this year, and it\\'s a new group of kids. So, she will not know anyone when she goes in for seventh grade in school, because we started talking about it. I said, \"Well, most likely you\\'ll be going in, because you guys can\\'t stay remote forever.\"\\n\\n\\tAnd she, herself expressed that, she said, \"I don\\'t know if I would feel comfortable with the schedule, with the noise again, and people I don\\'t know.\" So, I foresee that being an issue. And the schedule, they\\'d have to get up earlier. They can\\'t just leave the class because they\\'re bored, or walk around with their laptop into a different room because they want to get comfortable. They got to sit at their desk all the time. It\\'s a lot more rigid, there\\'s limitations with that.\\n\\n\\tBut on the other hand, I think having that schedule and having that set routine will be helpful. It\\'s just, I foresee the adjustment period being difficult. And from my youngest, he actually had a lot of anxiety going to school, because of all the issues he was having. He found school being completely overwhelming, and the noise, and the concentration, and the duration of classes was really horrible for him. We would deal with crying spells and meltdowns every single morning. \\n\\n\\tI\\'m not looking forward to that, and I anticipate that happening. But at the same time, being ADHD and ODD, being remote is not working for him. So, obviously, he would have to go back to school. Again, I may need some hardcore liquor just to get me through those mornings, because that used to be grueling for us every single morning. \\n\\n\\tSo, for us, parting with the comfort and the informality, but at the same time, looking forward to in-person interactions, social interactions, because that\\'s getting shunted right now. I feel like they\\'re missing out on that and their development is sliding backwards. Because on the screen friends are not the same as in real life friends. \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYou\\'re muted. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI\\'m still muted. Yeah, sorry. It\\'s noisy outside my window, so I\\'m trying to mute myself whenever I can. Thank you, Parent 3. That\\'s a good transition into just, for the next 10 or 15 minutes, I\\'d like to just focus a little bit on talking about gaming, specifically.\\n\\n\\tI\\'d like to hear from you a little bit about what was your kids\\' exposure or experience with gaming before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before the pandemic? Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSure. Sure. Yeah. Well, for Parent 4, Child 2, of course, as I said, the seven-year-old, she just wasn\\'t allowed to do it, so it didn\\'t change. And right now, I don\\'t think she really has the time or facilities to get involved in it, because I won\\'t let her when I\\'m around, and then in school, people are monitoring. So, it\\'s not an issue for her.\\n\\n\\tFor Parent 4, Child 1, she had started doing that, playing the games and all, but it was just because she didn\\'t have full access to a computer all the time, except just when she was doing homework. It was just, \"Here\\'s your time. Now your time\\'s over. Now you\\'re done.\" I didn\\'t really mind. I would have preferred it was something other than computer game, but if that\\'s what she wanted to do, I didn\\'t really have an issue with that. \\n\\n\\tBut it\\'s just that, now, it just seems like it\\'s always available. And even, sometimes with certain restrictions, she could find a way around it. Instead of using Safari, which was restricted by the computer, she found a way to use Chrome, and I had to work around that. I called Apple and spent hours on the phone to try to figure out how to block that too. And so, it became a real struggle. \\n\\n\\tI think we\\'ve got it under control, but it just does seem that it\\'s just much more focus on the screen. For us, I don\\'t think it\\'s so much that gaming has taken over, because I do have restrictions, but it\\'s just the focus on the computer. And certainly in the time she has, she would go to that. And it\\'s definitely become a social aspect at this point.\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s like, \"Oh, can I have a come over?\" And then they want to sit and play computer games together. So, \"Dude, you just spent all day on the computer, you could have done that at a come over? She\\'s finally in front of you and you\\'re going to sit in front of the computer together?\" It\\'s just crazy to me. So...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHas she met new people through the game, or it\\'s just the type of thing now that with the friends she\\'s going to-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nNo. No. She\\'s focused so much on just making friends with people she knows in the game. And she\\'s mentioned a couple other people, but I have always made it real... We\\'ve been very strong for the fact that, \"I don\\'t want you be with people you don\\'t know.\" And as far as I know, she\\'s been respectful of that. Maybe she doesn\\'t let me know, but I think that she\\'s pretty respectful of that. And it\\'s, for her, it\\'s more fun if there are people she already knows. She already has a relationship with them, so that makes it more interpersonal, somehow.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 4. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnyone else, gaming before or now, and benefits, concerns? Yes, Parent 5.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nIt took me a minute to remember before. Well, I mean, one reason is, one of the things I study, and I\\'m teaching a class on video games now, it\\'s complicated in my house because I am a video gamer. And I knew that, going, before I had kids, that this would be part of our lives. It doesn\\'t mean that they can play whenever and whatever they want. \\n\\n\\tMy kids played some games before the pandemic. I had a lot of control though, because they were not, at that point, technologically able to turn on or unlock any real game by themselves, completely by themselves. They could ask for it and I could give it to them or not. I think that they did have more TV access, typical stuff, but not so much with video games, but they did play. I liked that, but then again, I was curating the game, so I was comfortable with that.\\n\\n\\tNow, it is, I think I\\'m still maintaining better control over games than just YouTube access. For me, YouTube is the thing that is everywhere and you can\\'t block it out well enough. Also, it\\'s just, an eight year old shouldn\\'t be watching, 20 year olds, to eight hours a day, just, even if they\\'re not swearing, or something. It\\'s just things that he\\'s learning, that he shouldn\\'t be learning yet. \\n\\n\\tBut he does come home, and that\\'s what all he wants. He wants to play Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft. It\\'s not a bad game, but he doesn\\'t have any control. I can\\'t set an hour long limit for him that he would respect. Like I said, I do set limits, but I have to be active in a way that\\'s hard when I\\'m working full-time, and not getting... We\\'re not out of the house enough, still, I guess, to make it easier, because he can\\'t think of anything else to do. That\\'s the real problem.\\n\\n\\tIf I take it away, I have to take it away for like a whole weekend and he\\'ll start remembering, \"Oh yeah, I can think of, we can come up with these other games.\" But as soon as they get a day of playing games, like I sleep in and they manage to turn it on, then it\\'s just moping and, \"I can\\'t play. I can\\'t think of anything. I\\'m bored.\" I guess it\\'s a skill that they\\'re going to have to learn though. The ability to respect limits, but also recognize, make choices.\\n\\n\\t\"I have this much gaming time, and I\\'m going to actively choose what I want to play.\" He\\'ll do something like, \"But I didn\\'t get to do this thing I wanted to do.\" I was like, \"Well, you should have done it before your time right now.\" I don\\'t know when an eight year old with ADHD is really going to develop that. I definitely had to give in for a while, when they were home all the time. I had to give into it just to get my work done. And that\\'s what I didn\\'t like about the pandemic stuff.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. I see Parent 2 nodding, I know that\\'s something that you mentioned before also, just the need to give in to it.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, definitely. I mean, we weren\\'t seeing anyone also, right? This was the only way they could communicate with their friends. I mean, they had each other, but then that was always going to be okay for a little bit, but then they get in fights, and they need their space. Yeah, I\\'m trying to have the house quiet so I can be on a call, and that would be the only thing I could do for them to not bother me while I\\'m trying to work.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOr not start a screaming match in the background, that you can hear.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nRight. Yeah. Now, yeah, it\\'s just snowballed into this... I didn\\'t have an iPad for them. It would be like, \"Okay, you can borrow my phone here and there, to play the game.\" But then it became like, \"Oh my God, I got to keep them busy when school wasn\\'t keeping them busy.\" Because they just had to do it on their own, and they\\'re too young to really... I was the teacher, and working, and trying to do my job and keep them happy. And not enough time and energy for all of that to work.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAny other concerns or problems that any of you experienced, regarding gaming? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nIf I can go?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOne of my main concerns is, as mentioned before, by many of us, kids having access to games and being able to talk to people in the game, I don\\'t know who these people are. They may not be who they say they are. And I\\'ve tried to talk to my kids about stranger danger and online safety. \\n\\n\\tBut again, when they feel like they\\'ve connected with someone, it\\'s hard for them to not... They could give away certain information without meaning to, or realizing to. And so, then they open themselves up and, potentially, the family up for whatever dangs there are. \\n\\n\\tI remember I have to constantly remind them, like, \"If someone\\'s asking you how old you are, if you\\'re a boy or a girl, it doesn\\'t matter. You joke around with them, you don\\'t have to be rude. You could say, \\'I\\'m a dog, and I\\'m seven in dog years, or something.\\' Like, \\'Well, I\\'m 40 in dog years.\\' Make it a joke. Say, \\'I\\'m an alien. I\\'m a monster.\\' So they think that you\\'re just goofing around.\\'\\'\\'\"\\n\\n\\tI want them to understand that people may not what they are, but they have this image in their head, of who they\\'re playing with. And it\\'s hard, because we\\'re talking about seven year olds and 60 year olds playing in the same platform. They\\'re all different frames of mind, and different psychological stability, you know? So, I have that concern.\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s been hard for me to explain it to the younger one. The older one seems to get it, but even so, there\\'s still issues. That\\'s been the biggest thing for me with the games. Aside all the horrible things, in terms of addiction, isolation, ignoring me when I ask for something, and having tantrums when I take it away, but the safety. And understanding that you have to keep in mind that you don\\'t know who\\'s on the other end. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s really an important point, especially-\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI would not say that accounts for my kids. That\\'s the one thing I have managed to keep control of, because they needed... So far, everything needed me to okay it. It would be great if they could play with their friends, and they let them play one game like that, which was among us.\\n\\n\\tBecause the chat time was so short that... It wasn\\'t as bad as some of the others. But there are still problematic things that happened, because I played it, like friends that play, it is adults and children.\\n\\n\\tAnd I tried to talk to them about the same thing. About, \"You shouldn\\'t ever give out your age.\" And like, \"But why?\" \"It doesn\\'t matter.\" I was like, \"Well, because sometimes people can use that information to locate children and kidnap them.\" Was like, \"I wouldn\\'t go with them.\" \\n\\n\\tAnd I\\'m just like, \"Just stop giving away information about yourself.\" That\\'s one area I\\'m very hesitant to give them access to, but the pressure is mounting as more of their friends are doing it. And it is a social... I like the social part if it\\'s all eight year olds, or something, but the mixed group thing was very difficult. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. I guess last question... I feel like I know the answer to this, based on some of the things you said. And so, thinking about the changes that have happened in gaming use, is there anything with gaming that you would like to see continue as we return back to school? What do you hope for about gaming, as we go back?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWell, I think you already know my answer to that.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, I feel like this has come up. I mean, Parent 5, you did bring up that there can be a nice social aspect, but it also seems like there\\'s a pressure, because everybody is using it. So, restrict their use of it, then you\\'re leaving them out of something that everybody else is doing. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI mean, there\\'s also positive things. Granted, I hate the darn thing. It\\'s driving me mad. And yes, they are in it way too much. But it forced my son to start doing math, because when he\\'s in Minecraft and he has to calculate his resources, even though he says he hates math, somehow, he\\'s able to quickly pick up on how many more resources he needs, what he has, and how much of it he needs. It just becomes second nature to him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I tried to explain to him before, when he said, \"I hate math. It\\'s useless.\" I said, \"But you use math in Minecraft.\" He says, \"No, but that doesn\\'t count, because that\\'s fun.\" You know? It has its positive aspect. Also, my husband is a gamer, and this gives them an opportunity to bond, and they can play the games together. Also, on the days when they can see their friends, they could play the games together among us. When they do a private game and they\\'ll do it together, that\\'s fine.\\n\\n\\tIf there could be some way to ensure that we\\'re not having such different range of ages play, and we could ensure, in some way, the safety of them playing on, and maybe have more control in limitations, in terms of how much time they can spend on there, I don\\'t mind it. Because, like I said, it has some uses. It forced him to read, also, because he has to read the instructions, you know? Whereas before, he would just walk away. It does, but if it\\'s uncontrolled, unmonitored, it\\'s just free for all, and definitely, yeah. That\\'s my five cents out there.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWell said, Parent 3. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd one-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYes. Yeah, Parent 5?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOne positive was... And it was among us again. Just, I don\\'t know why that one game, but my kids have a same-age cousin, who, they\\'ve always lived on opposite sides of the country. So they\\'ve met her a few times, but they\\'ve actually formed a closer relationship with her than they ever did before. \\n\\n\\tBecause my brother and I were just more motivated, because they weren\\'t each seeing their separate friends, so we connected them on the phone so they could talk and play this game together at the same time. But yeah, that was in a private room with, with, I\\'m trying to keep an eye on who else is joining. And these games, if all on the developers\\' side, they absolutely could make it safer.\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, as long as it\\'s definitely not made with kids in mind, and YouTube made YouTube Kids, but you can\\'t block out... I don\\'t know. Maybe there needs to be more pressure. I just feel like YouTube shouldn\\'t be something that you can\\'t say, \"Look, I don\\'t want it on this computer.\" You can\\'t block it, because if you block it on Safari, you can get to it through-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAlso Chrome.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\n... Google searches. It shouldn\\'t be that difficult to say, \"I\\'m the parent, I don\\'t want this.\" \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. But I guess the developer-\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd I usually do it all the time.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt sounds like the developer-\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing that they can do. Yeah. But they have no motivation to do it right now-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\n... because they\\'re making money. That could be done, I don\\'t know how to make them do it, though.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. And we just still have to operate in this world where it\\'s not done. So, okay. Any last thoughts on gaming before we end it for today?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI think it\\'ll be a hard road to introduce balance into his life on, and after times, whatever the hell that is. Because, to pry him away from the screen, when that\\'s been his lifeblood over more than a year, it\\'s going to be very hard to get him biking, and hanging out with friends, and whatever. I think it\\'s going to be hard.\\n\\n\\tJust because they do talk over games with his specific friends, it\\'s going to be step-by-step and two steps backwards, several times. I mean, you really have to gird yourself for... When you want to just burst free into this other thing, it doesn\\'t work that way. Usually, you got to keep these incremental little things. That\\'s frustrating. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Okay. Well, I know that\\'s not the happiest time to end up on. But I just want to say I really appreciate everyone taking time, and really going in depth on technology with that. This is really helpful for our research, to hear the qualitative side of exactly how it\\'s impacting everyone. Administrator, are you available? Are you there? Do you want to just tell them about the town hall, or the compensation?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSorry. I\\'m doing multiple things in one time.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry. I know. I should have texted you on phone, first.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nNo. So sorry, Moderator 1. Yeah, so I\\'m on the call. I just want to reiterate what Moderator 1 said. Just, thank you guys so much for just participating in today\\'s group, and all the information that you gave us. It\\'s really useful, all the information that you gave us.\\n\\n\\tBecause, as we\\'re seeing just with our families, we\\'re just seeing a lot of commonalities in the ways in which technology and the pandemic have just been beneficial and not beneficial. We just thank you guys for your time today. \\n\\n\\tIn regards to the compensation, you should receive compensation no later than tomorrow evening. If not, by Friday, but it should come in tomorrow. And if you have any questions or concerns, you guys can just email me back at the emails.\\n\\n\\tI know some of you guys had multiple emails, but you guys can just respond to any of those emails, or you can give me a call at my number. It\\'s going to be at the bottom of the emails. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. It was really nice to meet you all. And thank you, again. Have a good rest of the afternoon.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAll right, thank you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay. All right. You too.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBye. (silence).'b'Parent 1:\\n\\n(silence) Hello. \\n\\nAdministrator: \\n\\n(silence) Hi, everyone. I\\'m [Administrator 00:02:05]. I\\'m the one that\\'s been contacting you guys about the focus group. Thank you guys so much for being here. We\\'re just waiting for our clinician Moderator 1 to get on the call, and then we\\'ll get started. (silence) Hi. Sorry, guys. I\\'m talking to my coworker, but I see you guys. I\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi everyone. Welcome. I\\'m Moderator 1. I\\'ll be leading the discussion today. We\\'re just going to wait for a couple more people that sign on. Thank you so much for joining. Administrator, how many people are we expecting today?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nWe should have a full house, so six. (silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI think we\\'re still waiting for a couple more people to join, but maybe we can just get started with some introductions. My name is Moderator 1. I work with the Healthy Brain Network. I\\'m a neuropsychologist. Maybe we could just go around, say your name and maybe the ages of your kids. Parent 1, do you mind to start us off?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m Parent 1. I\\'m a mother of twin girls who are both seven, so double the trouble and [crosstalk 00:05:34] everything all at once.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 1. Nice to meet you. Parent 2, you want to go next?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi. I\\'m Parent 2. I am the mother of seven, ages five, two, 21.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWow. Okay. So you\\'ll be able to provide a perspective across the age ranges. That\\'s actually very helpful. Nice to meet you, Parent 2.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYou too.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi, everyone. I\\'m Parent 3. I have three children, two of whom are being remote schooled right now, so if I mute and I look like I\\'m gesticulating and screaming at people off camera, that\\'s why. My oldest is almost 11, my middle is almost nine and my little is four.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 3. Nice to meet you. Maybe we\\'ll get to see a live demonstration of how technology impacts education.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nFingers crossed we won\\'t.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Parent 4? Is that the right name? Sometimes people have a different name written down there.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. I\\'m actually Parent 4.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. I should rename it. As you can see, he\\'s active in the virtual world. His name pops up first before mine. Okay. I\\'ve done the change. Okay. Yeah. Hi. I\\'m Parent 4. I have an eight year old son who\\'s experiencing full remote learning, and it\\'s been highly structured so it\\'s been good actually for him and me. I\\'ve been able to really work on some target needs, but it\\'s been challenging. I don\\'t know if I can do this another year. I really don\\'t know [crosstalk 00:07:39].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:07:42], so I don\\'t think he can either.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right. Thank you, Parent 4. Yeah. We\\'re definitely interested to get a little more into that. Parent 5, hello again. Welcome.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHi, again. My name is Parent 5. I have two girls, one nine and one seven. They\\'re doing a hybrid model, but it\\'s mostly in person.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks, Parent 5. And then, Parent 6, I think that you\\'re having a little trouble with your audio, but we\\'ll do introductions when she comes back. Okay. The purpose of this group is to learn a little bit more in depth about how technology has impacted your kids over the course of the pandemic. You gave us a lot of useful information through the crisis survey, but this allows us to dig in a little deeper and really get some insights from you so that we can better understand the situation and really try to spotlight on what parents are experiencing.\\n\\n\\tJust to start off, maybe if everyone could grab a paper and a pen, if you have one nearby, and just try to write down a couple of positive ways that you\\'ve noticed that technology has impacted your children since the pandemic and also try to outline a couple of negative ways that technology has impacted your children. [inaudible 00:10:25] have a couple down in each category, I\\'d like you to try to think which of the two categories you think have had a [inaudible 00:10:36] overall impact, and then circle which category has had the bigger impact as the positive influences or the negative effects had a bigger role [inaudible 00:10:49]. I\\'m hearing a lot of background noise from someone. I think, Parent 6, is that coming from you?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah. I can hear you now. Can you hear me?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou can hear us now. Great. Yes. Awesome. I think we might be getting ... All right. No. I don\\'t hear the background noise anymore. Great. I\\'m glad you can hear us. Maybe, Parent 6, if you want to just introduce yourself and say the ages of your kids.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nHi. I\\'m Parent 6 and I have two boys, one age 14 and one age 13.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thank you so much for joining us. We were just taking some time to try to outline a couple of positives impacts that you\\'ve noticed technology have on your children over the past year since the pandemic started, and also if you\\'ve noticed any negative effects, and then just trying to think overall which has stood out the more, the positive impacts of technology or the negative.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI\\'d say the positive is obviously they\\'ve been working remotely from school, which they are still doing. We felt safe that they could be at home and on Zoom and listening to teachers, interacting with friends, trying to be a little bit social online and just being part of the classroom setting. I guess that was positive. I\\'m actually glad that they\\'re home and they won\\'t be going until September. We made that choice. Obviously, the negative effects of that is way to much time on the screen because they\\'re on the screen throughout the day for school, and then they want their phone time on screens.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nTo me, it is way too much time just sat in front of a computer.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks Parent 6. I\\'ll ask you to go a little more into that in a few minutes. Just to get a general understanding, by show of hands, how many of you feel like the positives impacts of technology have had the greater overall impact? I see Parent 5, Parent 4, Parent 6. Anyone else feel like the positive has been greater overall?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nFor one of my daughters.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 1? Okay. Depends which one, so it\\'s different depending on the kids. Okay. Yeah. We\\'ll discuss that. Who feels like the negative impacts have been a greater overall impact? Parent 2 and Parent 3. Okay.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNo, no. I\\'m sorry. I was waving at my daughter.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou were waving at your daughter.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nMy vote was positive.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYour vote was positive. Okay.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nCan I ask a quick question?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Of course.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWhen answering these questions, am I thinking only of my special needs child or all my kids?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll your kids.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. We\\'re interested to hear whatever insights you have overall.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay. Got you. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So for the first question ... Well, before I get started, what we\\'ve seen is that a lot of parents have had a lot of overlapping experiences, and then we\\'ve definitely seen that there are parents who have more unique experiences or different experiences, and we really appreciate that everyone really feel free to chime in if you have had a different experience than someone else is saying. We really want to try to welcome all perspectives. I just want to start by saying that. For the first question that I\\'d like to put out there is just if you could share ... First, I\\'d like to focus on education and how technology has impacted your children\\'s education. If you could share was technology used for education for your kids before the pandemic, and then did you have any concerns about it before the pandemic, or did you find it beneficial before the pandemic, and then how did that change once the pandemic hit? Would anyone like to start us off?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nWell, I think technology with kids these days is always a part of education, even for research or doing some assignments at home and sending them in. I know for my kids it was always there, but since the pandemic obviously everything now is done via technology.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you just find that it\\'s just going to be necessary during this time.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nDefinitely during this time. Definitely.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. And then, also in general as well.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks, Parent 6. Can someone else ... Yeah, Parent 5.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThe technology use before the pandemic for my nine year old was a little bit for school, half an hour maybe of iPad time a day, and then when we switched to all remote in March of last year it became the entirety of their experience is all on the iPad whether it was asynchronous or synchronous. Are you asking if it\\'s a positive change?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo. Both. Just explaining how it changed and then also what concerns or benefits you\\'ve seen.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThe benefits surprisingly, my nine year old was having a lot of social issues in school. She was having problems with her teachers and problems with other kids. When it became remote school, it\\'s the perfect solution for her because she was able to focus on the work and didn\\'t have to deal with the ... I think she was overwhelmed by interacting with one kid at a time. With the change, remote school was an ideal solution for her. When they went to hybrid learning in October, she had matured enough or maybe she had gained confidence, I don\\'t know what the difference was, but she was able to negotiate the social situations that she had not been able to deal with before. It\\'s been an overall very positive experience.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nInteresting. You already saw those positive impacts play out even as she returned.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI would say too my son was diagnosed with ADD and seemed to focus so much better from home without any distractions from classmates and the anxiety from being in the classroom, people looking at him or [inaudible 00:18:18] put on the spot or whatever, and just having zero ... He sits in his room, never comes out, [inaudible 00:18:27] and just very focused. He\\'s actually doing better academically.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nNot socially, but academically there\\'s no extra noise going on.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks, Parent 6. Parent 1, you were going to ...\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah. For my family, there was no such thing as technology prior to the pandemic. We were given computers so that the kids could get on. It was just a production of how do we get on, what do we do, how do we use [inaudible 00:19:07], the different moving parts just to educate your child, be on top of your child with ADHD. Two of them which one of my children has emotional issues and the other one is just all over the place. It was pure hell back in March, and working full time from home trying to get it to happen. That\\'s when my husband and I had made a decision that if our kids are like this, maybe they need medication. We started going down the medication route and started our kids on medication this year in September. The medication actually has helped them a glorious amount from September to be able to be focused to be able to learn, to not talk back as much and what have you. The pandemic did that to us. We had been holding off for so long.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. Parent 1, may I ask you, did you have concerns about their attention prior to the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWell, yes. One of my daughters went through the whole healthy brain thing. We have the packet and we\\'re waiting for the other one to go through the process. One of them classified as emotionally disturbed and ADD, ADHD. The other one has sensory issues and ADD, ADHD, anxiety as well, and the other one suffers from depression. Emotions flying high just trying to help everyone and give everybody what they needed, and also try to work.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIt was just really, really challenging some days. I\\'m a school teacher. The work\\'s got to get done.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. It sounds like it was a pretty stressful time and really exacerbated some issues for your kids.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 1. Who would like to share next? Parent 2.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay. I think I\\'m probably taking the other side of what most people said. I hated online learning. As I said, I have seven children, and you can imagine what was going on in this house, seven different devices, eight different devices because my husband was working from home too. We didn\\'t even have them. My daughter runs down, she starts kicking my husband off the computer, \"I\\'m late for class,\" and he is talking to a patient. Thank God our kids all went back in September. One kid had to quarantine for two weeks because someone in her class got it, but other than that, they\\'ve all been in school and we are so grateful for that because the online learning was terrible. My daughter who\\'s five now, but she was four when the pandemic started, a four year old gains nothing from online learning. Even when she went back to school, she wasn\\'t in every day, I didn\\'t put her on the day she was on. I\\'d rather take her to the beach or take her to the park and give her real-life experiences where she\\'s gaining as opposed to just watching the screen.\\n\\n\\tMy high school kids hated it, my teenage girls, because the social interaction wasn\\'t there. They were texting in the middle of classes. Someone said to me, \"You\\'re going to let them do that?\" I said, \"Well, they talk in class. Let\\'s be real. They need the socialization.\" I did let them text during class. Overall, I don\\'t like to get my kids online, I don\\'t like the texting, I don\\'t like the phones, and it made it much harder to limit it. My 13 year old was ADHD, he was playing Lego during class. He couldn\\'t focus. Some of the teachers were just not understanding at all. Some I felt were much stricter than they would\\'ve been even in the classroom, and it was just very difficult for my kids.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. Across the board, challenging. They weren\\'t really learning.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNo. No learning going on.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNo learning going on.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks, Parent 2. Parent 4? You\\'re on mute, Parent 4. Sorry.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. Hold on. Parent 4, Child 1, could you log on? It\\'s time. Miss Johnson. Yes. Do you hear me? Acknowledge. Confirm. Okay. Anyway. The benefits outweigh this. There is a silver lining. I\\'m very busy. I teach and I tutor and I do a lot of freelance marketing because that\\'s my background. I had to splice away all of that, and so the negative is the income became significantly last, but I\\'ve also lowered my expenditure, shall we say, and I got to spend time with my son. I felt like I didn\\'t rely on the school system. I got to see my son in his way. I learned how to work with them and we still are. It\\'s a work in progress. I actually changed his school amidst this pandemic. It provoked a lot of sleepless nights, I didn\\'t know whether to do it or not, but being the ADHD where he\\'s [inaudible 00:25:23], I experienced a lot of what other people said about ...\\n\\n\\tHe would get on, but these pockets of time in between was disconcerting. I couldn\\'t handle it. I\\'m a single mom. It just felt like Jekyll and Hyde pulling and pushing. And then, in the beginning a year ago in March, April, it didn\\'t feel like remote learning at his former school. Even though it\\'s a wonderful school, it felt like assignment learning. They just stacked on the assignments. There were times we would just spend until midnight completing one assignment because in between, we\\'d just be running around the apartment, there were just so many tantrums. It\\'s their way of reacting to this pandemic and the sudden change of environments. I get it, but I actually put them into a school. It is structured, but not as negative as what people say. People do know the school system quite well. I\\'m actually rather impressed. They have them in school from 9:00 to 3:00 full time, non-stop. When they\\'re doing their work independently, they\\'re still logged on.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n9:00 to 3:00 virtually.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. Virtually. It has to be fully remote, but what they\\'ve set up is this full system on the Chromebooks and they use a platform called GoGuardian where there\\'s three teachers by the way in the classroom and they watch as the child is doing the work. The silver lining here is that I feel like there\\'s more one-on-one [inaudible 00:27:12]. I have to say, I\\'m a teacher so I\\'m really honing in and learning and seeing what they\\'re doing, how they\\'re carrying about. I was rather impressed with this engagement that seemed more in the moment, live.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIf the child is doing their math problem incorrectly, they\\'ll say, \"What\\'s going on there? Rethink this. Do this. Fix that strategy.\" As a result, my son\\'s grades have increased while the sacrifice of socioemotional is there also. With ADHD, I feel like there\\'s this ability to focus because ADHD involved processing, and so this ability to hone in on the screen has been really wonderful. Also, we started the medication process as well. The silver lining here, which this is my last point, is that I was able to work on the medication management, so I had actually really good data to provide to the psychiatrist and what have you. When he goes to school, and they\\'re starting school in August, August 2, they\\'re cutting the school year end of May, and then the school is starting the school year the ninth of August after he comes back [inaudible 00:28:34] because they feel like there\\'s still a learning loss despite this structured system, and so they\\'re starting school early the second of August. I think he\\'ll be more prepared all because of this time that we had, although it\\'s been [crosstalk 00:28:54].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt sounds like you\\'ve been able to take this time and become really involved in his education.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnd he\\'s been able to make some improvements and-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Interesting.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI think also, I would add that it depends on the school too.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nMy son\\'s high school, I think they\\'ve done such a wonderful job. We were away with a friend for two weeks, and she goes to one of the great high schools here in New York City, and I hated how they taught. She was all over the place, and there was no accountability. She would log on, but then she\\'d be texting, [inaudible 00:29:32] breakfast, she was loud. I\\'m like, \"How is she learning anything?\" This was Clinton. She goes to Clinton. Whereas my son, he logs on and he has to be on camera. If they ask a question and he does not answer or respond, [inaudible 00:29:49] and they have to have a reason why. He\\'s had a lot of accountability. My middle schooler started very light. To me, they weren\\'t doing enough, but they progressed and they seem to be doing a much better job. I was just really [inaudible 00:30:06] the difference between two high schools. My son knows he has to get on, he has to be on camera, he has to participate, he has to give an assignment some time, or we get text, we get notified. For him, I think it\\'s been very positive academically.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, Parent 6. Thanks for highlighting that. Yeah. I think it sounds like there is a big difference-\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSchool-wise.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n... on how they\\'re able to [inaudible 00:30:35] technology.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI feel like some of the smaller day schools, because we\\'re in a small school rather than [inaudible 00:30:42] high school, I seem to feel like the smaller ones have been able to handle it slightly better for some reason.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nInteresting.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nWith less students.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 3, do you want to share a little bit? We can come back to you if you-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNo. I can share. Parent 3, Child 1 is supposed to be in socialization class. He\\'s wandering. I\\'ll start with Parent 3, Child 1, my oldest, who has speech therapy and occupational therapy. Prior to the pandemic, he did have an iPad at school where we tried to use an app called TouchChat that didn\\'t quite work. He\\'s very familiar with ... Well, see, the teacher wants you to unmute. Put this on. Parent 3, Teacher asked you a question. [inaudible 00:31:31]. Sorry. [inaudible 00:31:34] and answer Parent 3, Teacher. Remote school [inaudible 00:31:38]. There\\'s a question just about the technology or remote schooling in general?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI\\'m curious about how technology has impacted your child\\'s education.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay. We focus on the positive. The children have been remote, and they will be remote until September. Technology has enabled them to connect with their friends. They haven\\'t missed a day of school, unless we took a mental health day which have been necessary on occasion.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Sure.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI would say that the main benefit for me is that the children are now more self-reliant. Parent 3, Child 1 has had to figure out how to navigate a computer. He has to put the password in and turn it on and open up the internet himself, which he was able to do on an iPad, but now he\\'s fluent with a PC for example. My other son, his class is fully in person. He\\'s the only remote student. This has been very interesting. A positive for him is that my middle son has auditory processing disorder, so I\\'ve been able to observe how he learns, make ... What? No. Not you. My daughter ... I\\'m sorry. She said I haven\\'t spoken about her. My four year old had just started nursery school when this all happened, but she was not connecting on the Zoom, not because she wasn\\'t able, but she does not like speaking and not being acknowledged. She does not like raising her hand and not being called on, and she did not like not being able to just socialize with her friends on the Zoom when she was in class.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nShe has not been back to school. Fingers crossed she will be back in September. Overall, then technology has been a positive. With Parent 3, Child 1, we\\'ll see how it shakes out socially though because he is a loner by nature and also he is on the spectrum, and so socializing is not his favorite thing. He\\'s been able to give into his tendency to just want to be alone with an iPad, which is a downside. We\\'re hoping that we will smoothly transition back into in-person school in September and he\\'ll be able to reconnect with all of his friends, right Parent 3, Child 1?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 3. Actually, you just gave me the perfect transition because my next question is as we do start to return and people are going back or have gone back, I\\'d like to hear from you guys about what challenges you anticipate chasing as your kids start to integrate back, if you think there will be challenges-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'ll start that one since I finished the last one.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 3.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWe have been socializing as much as we can. We try to facilitate safe play dates outside with masks on, but it\\'ll be interesting to see how Parent 3, Child 1 integrates back into an in-person world. I think this is his sweet spot. He\\'s loved this, and it helps that he has siblings because I know only children are [inaudible 00:34:58] in this situation. He does have some interaction, but really we are I wouldn\\'t say concerned, but we\\'re just going to have this top of mind, how to get him back on track socially.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you\\'re anticipating it, and you\\'re going to have to be quite conscious of it.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah. The great thing is Parent 3, Child 1 is actually graduating and going to middle school, which for his school would involve him going to a new building. This is also top of mind for his school because they are holding his class in another back in their elementary school building where he\\'s been since preschool. They want to make this transition as easy as possible for Parent 3, Child 1 and his classmates.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nInteresting.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnyone else about anticipating? Yeah, Parent 2.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nLike I said, all my kids did go back already, but even my kids who did not like school before the pandemic were happy to go back to school, which I guess was a plus about the whole thing, even the ones who had the social anxiety. I have 12th grader. She hated school until this point. I\\'m not going to say she loves school now, but she appreciates it so much more, even the socialization which she did not like. She\\'s just much happier. For us, going back to school was a tremendous benefit, and of course for our four year old who gains nothing. Like [inaudible 00:36:28] said, [crosstalk 00:36:29] home there\\'s no [inaudible 00:36:31] school.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nInteresting. Yeah.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah. My 14 year old always loved school. He really loved his middle school. He started a new high school that he has not set one foot inside, so that\\'ll be interested when he just go back, but he loved his elementary and loved his middle school. My younger one, my 13 year old, was always the kind of kid if he could stay home, he would. He says, \"I have a stomachache.\" He never loved school, but he did say to me a few weeks ago that he missed school, that he did miss going on. We\\'ve been out since March of last year too, so it is a long time. I was very surprised to hear him say that it is better to be in school, even though he\\'s also very shy and it\\'s not like he has a ton of friends in school, but I just think just being around kids their own age I think is so important.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nThe other one seems happy at home, but [inaudible 00:37:37] friends. I thought he would actually miss it more because he, like I said, loved his school, but it was just surprising to hear my younger one say school is actually better.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. I\\'m hearing that it seems similar to what Parent 2 was saying that [crosstalk 00:37:57] not have liked school, that they actually gained an appreciation.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah. He used to complain about going to school and school was boring. Now, it\\'s like, \"I want to be in school.\"\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo. That\\'s really interesting. Anyone else? Parent 4, Parent 1? Yeah, Parent 1.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy kids have been back at school, not back at school, back at school, not back at school. Someone gets COVID and then it gets shut down. My daughter actually when she was six got COVID. Everybody in our entire house had to [inaudible 00:38:36] and this, that and other things. There\\'s this sensationalized trauma of what is COVID and am I going to die. My kids really didn\\'t understand it, the one that got it. She sneezed the other day, and they\\'re like, \"Well, if your child has any sort of symptoms of seasonal allergies or something like that, you need to bring in a doctor\\'s note to the nurse so that they\\'re not going to be sent home for seasonal allergies.\"\\n\\n\\tIt gets to a point where they called me because she complained of a cough or something. I went and I took her to the doctor\\'s, I went and took her to the pediatrician\\'s office. I got a note saying that there was nothing wrong with my child, so I went back to the school, I dropped her right back off at school, gave them a note and they\\'re like, \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"There\\'s nothing wrong with my child. Here. Educator, this is where she needs to be in order to learn.\" Because they\\'re trying to throw them off and to get rid of them because it\\'s easier that way, because if they\\'re a trouble maker or one that makes things a little bit more challenging, it\\'s easier to have one less. Why not just have one less in the class that does that? That\\'s really the way that I felt with her whereas her sister, they understand she has allergies. She\\'s had a sniffle for the past seven months. It\\'s not gone away. It\\'s just the whole am I going to get it, can I get a vaccination, those sorts of questions are what [crosstalk 00:40:46].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. So that\\'s a whole new complicating factor is even just the health concerns and COVID and kids dealing with that.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4, do you want to share any challenges you anticipate or anything with the integrating back in August?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. I think I\\'m more nervous. Actually, we had a choice of doing remote learning versus hybrid two day versus five day. Being that this is a particular charter school, not all charter schools are the same, but this very good school laid down the policies just last week, and they basically create this model to incentivize the parents to bring back the kids to the school. Now, if a child has an IEP, and mine does being that he has ADHD and speech, so they\\'re saying that the kids with the IEPs have to come back to the classroom. That\\'s interesting for me because I was actually thinking of keeping them remote until he gets the vaccine.\\n\\n\\tI\\'m very anxious to answer your question because my son is very fidgety even though he\\'s on the medication. He\\'s very fidgety, and he\\'s very touchy. I have a feeling you guys know what I\\'m talking about. It\\'s very concerning to me because we\\'re all so germ phobic. I know that there are some kids out there who get it, and we can\\'t even see, we can\\'t even tell that they\\'re sick even though they\\'re COVID positive. To me, we don\\'t know everything about this COVID virus, and so we don\\'t know if maybe there are some hidden effects on the child that we will not discover until they\\'re older. The lack of full awareness of the science and the epidemiology behind this is what\\'s concerning me.\\n\\n\\tNow, I\\'m actually getting ready mentally to have him back in school. It\\'d be good for him, although I\\'m very worried about the EF skills because I\\'ve actually been his support helping him organize like, \"Hey, you have an exam. Don\\'t forget. Let\\'s study.\" I have access to information because I\\'m hearing everything and seeing everything, but this is going to be a transition. I\\'ll just leave it at that. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo. Yeah. No. I think you highlighted some important aspects of transitioning back. It sounds like you in particular have been able to really get an up close view, and then having to pull back and see if he can do these skills independently. It\\'s definitely something to think about. Parent 5, it looks like you\\'re out and about. Do you want to share any challenges your child\\'s facing [crosstalk 00:44:07]?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nShe\\'s hybrid now, and it\\'s going really well. I can\\'t think of what\\'s coming that will be challenging when they go back to full class. That might be a challenge for her just because it\\'s more kids and that might provoke nervousness, but she\\'s been doing so well in person, and she\\'s so excited about school now. She was hesitant to go to school sometimes pre-COVID. I think it\\'s just a net positive. I feel very lucky.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Great, Parent 5. We have a little bit of time left. Maybe the last question I\\'ll put out there is just expanding. We\\'re focusing on education, so thinking about social media use, gaming, internet usage, how has that changed for your child, benefits, concerns, in that realm.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nWe have the same struggles that we always did. Trying to get them off, trying to get them off Fortnite. With the additional screen time that they get, I think they thought they could get more screen time for the fun games, but it\\'s like no. Even though you finished earlier, you finished school earlier, you\\'re home, we\\'re around the apartment a lot more than if you were in school, that does not equal more video game time. We\\'ve made a real conscious effort to still limit that and watch what they\\'re doing and how much time because we still make them go out every day. They have to go, even if they take a walk. You need to get out even during the winter. We all need to go out, get some fresh air. You can\\'t just vegetate on a video game. We\\'ve always been that way.\\n\\n\\tLike I say, their expectations are like, \"Well, we\\'re not commuting back from school. There\\'s no after school, so we have more time.\" I\\'m like, \"Well, that does not mean more time on Fortnite or just wasting your brain doing absolutely nothing.\" It\\'s a constant battle, but it\\'s a battle we had pre-COVID too. They always want that five more minutes, five more minutes, five more minutes. It\\'s worse now than it used to be because there\\'s not as much going on, but we just have to be ... We\\'re the parents, whether it causes a huge fight sometimes. We just got to stick by it and limit the time. Sometimes, on the weekend they may get more time than we would like if we\\'re busy doing something, but we just set the rules and really try to keep it within a reasonable amount.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah. Thanks, Parent 6. Yeah, Parent 1.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'ll go. I\\'m a phys ed teacher, so when I was teaching, my kids would always try and come in and play and do the games that we were doing and that sort of thing. I found that my kids don\\'t want technology at all on the weekends. Now, we\\'ve come up with game night, we\\'ve come up with physical activity night, and then we\\'ve come up with movie night. Even sometimes they don\\'t even want to watch a movie because it is something that\\'s just going to drain your brain or what have you. Through COVID, we were going for walks every single morning just so that we could wake up our brains to get ready to learn. In terms of that, I guess that was a good bonding, positive thing. They got a chance to see mommy in action teaching a bunch of kids, other kids [inaudible 00:48:46] acting silly.\\n\\n\\tWe have a Nintendo Switch. We\\'ve used it four times a year because it causes more fights than anything because they\\'re trying to compete against each other when we\\'re just trying to be together and create those sorts of values. I\\'m sorry for those of you who have kids who love the technology world, but it\\'s been more of a family, so it was kind of good.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 1. Yeah. Anybody else share your experience with social media use, internet usage, gaming? Yeah, Parent 2.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMy eight year old, to get her on Zooms call, and when she was on the computer all she wanted was the fun of the computer. Pre-COVID, she was hardly ever on the computer. Now, I had to give her fun time on the computer every day. Once we switched to Zoom school, actually I started giving her 20 minutes a day of computer time where she could sit and watch something fun and whatever. That was very hard. When she started school again, I had to cut that back. I told her, \"No more.\" We brought it back down to 20 minutes a week as opposed to 20 minutes a day.\\n\\n\\tThe funny thing is that I don\\'t feel that more screen time necessarily contradicts with more outdoor time because when COVID started last March and the kids were home and they had some more free time between classes, my daughter learned to ride a two-wheeler, the other kid learned to ride roller blades. There was a lot of outside time as well. I don\\'t know that they necessarily contradict each other, but we really do try to steer clear of the screen time, but everyone ... You\\'re lucky, Parent 1. Everyone [inaudible 00:50:59] wants as much as they could get.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 2. Yeah. I hear what you\\'re saying that there can be both. One doesn\\'t have to preclude the other, but it\\'s just you have to set those limits.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nDo I have the two oldest kids too, 13, 14? I seem to have the oldest, right?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI think we have [inaudible 00:51:23] older kids.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI have a daughter who\\'s turning 22.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI think if I had an eight year old, this would be a completely different experience. Yeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nFor sure. Yeah. I think that\\'s why we appreciate having parents of kids of all ages because we are hearing that it is different based on that as well. Parent 3, Parent 4, anything to share regarding your changes in social media use, internet usage, any concerns or benefits, things you\\'d like to see stick around, things you\\'d like to see never [inaudible 00:52:02]?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWell, my son has also ... He\\'s not a picky eater. He\\'s a problematic eater, so he\\'s had a history of that since he was two and a half years old. His relationship to food is something that has to be focused on, even though he\\'s eight and a half. It\\'s a power struggle. Really, what it comes down to is it\\'s a power struggle. He won\\'t eat unless he gets to watch any. If I say no, then he\\'s like, \"Okay. I\\'m not going to eat,\" and he follows through with that. Being that we\\'re home all the time, that has manifested. We were really making headway with that, meaning where he doesn\\'t have a device. He had support for feeding, even in the school it was arranged. Now, with the pandemic it\\'s like he will not eat unless he gets to watch [inaudible 00:53:11].\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s almost because he doesn\\'t want to look at the food. You know what I mean? It\\'s just his way of escaping. It\\'s a sensory thing too, sensory avoidance. It\\'s something that has manifested. That is something I need to work on. He\\'s looking healthy, but he\\'s also very thin. He has been dizzy at a few times, and I do believe that the adrenaline, the overstimulation that is created by the ... It\\'s elicited by the use of these devices, otherwise prior to, it would just be the television. Now, all the devices are out, I have passwords on everything, but it\\'s a battle. I don\\'t like the little battles through the day. That\\'s what I don\\'t like.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. [crosstalk 00:54:04]. That can be very tricky.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 4. All right. So I think we can end [inaudible 00:54:16]. Does anyone have any last insights or anything we didn\\'t discuss that you think would be useful for us to know?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'m going to say something that might sound a little crazy, but I just want to share that-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGo for it.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI know I keep saying we try to take the positive, but I actually had what I felt like was a great learning moment with my middle child who I don\\'t know if you guys ... Do your kids play Among Us?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThis was his first exposure to online gaming, and so this was his first exposure to playing with strangers on the internet. It sparked the conversation about the dangers of the internet. He was in a room and people were asking. I had to teach him about tricky questions and how to be safe online. I thought it was important to still let him play it. I\\'m monitoring him the whole time, but this was a really great teaching moment for him. Thank, goodness. I shouldn\\'t have said Among Us out loud because he hasn\\'t played it in a month, but he\\'s probably going to be on it tonight. That was the positive.\\n\\n\\tAs for Parent 3, Child 1, Parent 4, I think you mentioned the overstimulation. Our struggle with that is I don\\'t know if you can hear Parent 3, Child 1, but when Parent 3, Child 1 falls into his iPad, he watches cooking videos and sometimes [inaudible 00:55:35] videos. I don\\'t know the ins and outs of how the brain works, but we can always tell when he\\'s on his iPad because [inaudible 00:55:43] up and up and up and up. The great thing is that whenever I tell any of them to put something down, they just put it down. Parent 3, Child 1 always asks to pick up his iPad which is great for his break time. We\\'ve fallen into a pattern of I just let them use it until it\\'s time to put it down.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah. Thanks, Parent 3, for bringing up also that cybersecurity aspect because we have heard about that from a few parents. Just highlighting that that definitely needs oversight and there has to be conversations around that. Okay. Parent 5, yeah?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI just wanted to say that although we don\\'t have these fights over technology, we have these same fights control and time allocated for reading. My daughter uses ... She\\'s an avid reader. She loves reading which is great, but she uses books as a negotiating tactic what meal she gets to read during. She uses it as a shield against interacting with people sometimes, just for what it\\'s worth.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah. I guess technology is not its own animal, I guess, if there are other similar [inaudible 00:57:11] we\\'re dealing with.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThat was me growing up, by the way.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh, really?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThat was totally me. I used to hide in the bathroom and read [crosstalk 00:57:23]. It\\'s a good thing.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt turned out well for you. All right. Well, thank you everyone. This has been a really great group. We really appreciate you giving us your insights and taking some time to share with us today. We\\'ve heard a lot of similar themes from parents, but a lot of new stuff came out today as well, so we really appreciate all of it. I\\'ll let Administrator end us off.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi, everyone. Just like Moderator 1 said, thank you guys so much for your participation today in our focus group. It not only helps us with the research that we\\'re doing, but the town hall that we are looking to host in either late May or early June. We\\'re looking to basically give resources to parents who are having a difficult time throughout the pandemic, and then also for parents who may not be having a difficult time because resources can be used for a multitude of reasons. We thank you guys so much for just all the information and insight you guys gave us today. In regards to compensation, you should receive it no later than Friday. It\\'s sent via email, so if you don\\'t receive an email from Amazon that says Healthy Brain Network or Child Mind Institute by Friday, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email or through phone call, through my phone number, and I will definitely be happy to assist and get that done. Thank you guys again.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right. Bye everyone. Have a great afternoon.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nBye. Thank you.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nBye. Be well everyone.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you. Bye everyone. Have a great day.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nBye.'b'Parent 1:\\n\\n(silence) Hi.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHow are you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m okay, how are you doing?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nGood, thank you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWe waiting for other people?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI guess so.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, good afternoon everyone.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi everyone.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, welcome. We\\'re just going to wait a few minutes for everyone to join, and hopefully [inaudible 00:02:01]. Administrator, how many parents are we expecting for this group?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nWe should have a full house.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, great. So six? Or five?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYep. [inaudible 00:02:21]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWelcome [Parent 3 00:02:27], we\\'re just waiting for everyone to join, and we\\'ll get started in a couple minutes.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi [inaudible 00:02:46], welcome. We\\'re just waiting for everyone to arrive, so I hope we will get started soon.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOkay, that\\'s fine. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:02:54]\\n\\nParent 1: \\n\\nParent 1? Would you open the far left window [inaudible 00:03:09]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:03:09]?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nProbably.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:03:26].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so I think we\\'re all here. Good afternoon, thank you everyone for joining and taking some time out to talk with us. I know everyone filled out the crisis survey already. And the purpose of this group is to really go a little bit more in depth, and hear everyone\\'s experiences, especially as it pertains to technology, and really just say your insight. So, before we get started, maybe we can just go around, introduce ourselves, and maybe just say the ages of your kids. So my name is Moderator 1, and I\\'m a neuropsychologist with [inaudible 00:04:19] Network. So I\\'ll just go around the screen, because we\\'re a big group today. So Parent 1, you want to introduce yourself?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSure, my name is Parent 1. I\\'m a parent of a seven year old and a nine year old.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSeven year old and nine year old. Okay. Welcome, thanks for joining.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIs it for me?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, I was trying to read your name. Hi.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI know, I get that... I\\'ve had that my whole life. My name is [Parent 2 00:04:47] [inaudible 00:04:47]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 2, hi. Nice to meet you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNice to meet you. And I am the parent of a 21 year old, and a 16 year old.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so you\\'ll be able to give us a little bit of an older perspective. Welcome.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 3.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Parent 3. I have an eight year old daughter and a six year old son. And my daughter is the one who\\'s been involved with the Healthy Brain Network.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks Parent 3. Parent 5?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHi, I have three girls. They\\'re 12, 10 and five.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, great. Okay. And then Parent 6, is that your name? I think you\\'re on mute.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYep, sorry. Sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI [inaudible 00:05:40] hi, we\\'re just going around and introducing ourselves. If you could just say your name, and maybe the ages of your kids.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSure, sorry. It\\'s Parent 6, and my kids are... Let me try to think a second. 16 and 22.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n16 and 22. Okay, great. Welcome. And then-\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\n16, 19...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh, I missed the 19. Okay. Welcome Parent 6. And then last but not least, we have Parent 4. Hi.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. So I\\'m Parent 4, and I have two sons, 15 and 17.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n15 and 17, okay. Great. We have a nice, wide range here today. Welcome everyone. So before we start discussing, I was hoping we could do a quick exercise. So if you have paper and pen nearby, maybe just take a couple minutes and let\\'s try to write down a couple of positive ways that you\\'ve noticed that technology has impacted your kids during the pandemic. And then, also try to identify a couple of negative ways that technology has impacted your kid during the pandemic. So let\\'s take a couple minutes to think about that, and then we\\'ll get into the discussion. (silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnd then, once you\\'ve done that, try to circle whichever group you think has had the bigger overall impact. So have the positive influences of technology had a bigger overall impact, or has the negative group had a bigger overall impact.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nModerator 1, not to be staffed, but when you say technology, are you talking about internet technology, or just like cars?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s a very question. So I am speaking more about like internet technology, as it applies to education, social media use, and gaming [inaudible 00:09:33].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:09:34] Yeah,, thanks for clarifying. Okay, so by a show of hands, how many people here circled the positive group as having the bigger overall impact. Parent 1, Parent 3, Parent 2, Parent 6. Okay. All right. And then who circles the negative group as having the bigger overall impact? Parent 5. I can\\'t see your response Parent 4, oh, but... Okay, so you\\'re saying the negative, the overall negative group. Thumbs up. Okay. So it seems like we definitely have some different perspectives here, and that\\'s something I really want to emphasis, is that from the groups that we\\'ve been doing, we\\'ve definitely noticed that a lot of parents have a lot of overlapping[inaudible 00:10:27], but then we really encourage you to also bring your own unique experience in, because I think some parents express how their children are doing, and if you are having a different experience, that\\'s something that\\'s very important to voice.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo I\\'m going to throw the first question out there. So I\\'d like to focus a little bit on how technology has impacted your children\\'s education. And so, if you could speak a little bit about how did they use technology for their education prior to the pandemic. Did you find it to be beneficial, did you have concerns about using technology before the pandemic? And then, since the pandemic, how have they used technology and what parts [inaudible 00:11:24] be beneficial, and what concerns have you had? So I know there\\'s a lot of parts to that question, but feel free to answer whatever you like. So does someone want to start us off?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah, I can start. I\\'m Parent 4.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh, okay.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4 and then Parent 5. Yeah, Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOkay. So you had a couple of questions, but I will just the negative aspects of the [inaudible 00:11:57] this pandemic and using all the technology and schooling from home has just thrown out all time constraints, in terms of bed time, meal time. And I think it upsets me more than it upsets my children. So they have a hybrid schedule at school, so the technology is a very big part of their school day, even more so than it was before, because they didn\\'t have Zoom class before. And yeah. So that\\'s how it has affected, that\\'s a negative aspect of it. And they work around it. They make it work for them. I think it\\'s me, it bothers me because it\\'s so much more than I would have liked it to be, in terms of being big on the screen and using the computers all the time. But the positive is, they\\'re communicating more verbally. So that\\'s a good thing. And so I think that is helping them develop their...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHow do you notice their communicating more verbally [crosstalk 00:13:15]\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah, they have to... I\\'m in presence of them when they\\'re in school remotely, and there\\'s just a lot of conversation. Especially my son, who participated in this program. He even reached out to his teachers to say, \"Call on my more.\" Because otherwise he won\\'t. I think I may have... Can you still hear me, because something just happened on my screen.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, we can hear you. Yeah yeah, we can hear you.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOkay. So yeah, so he asked to be called on more, because I think he realized that he was getting lost in the process, being remote. And it\\'s a big adjustment from when it first started. But yeah. [crosstalk 00:13:58]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so what I\\'m hearing from you is on the negative side, you notice it definitely messed with their routines and their sleep, and that\\'s something that has impacted you a lot. Then on the positive side, it seems like you\\'re having good verbal communication with him, and he\\'s actually advocating a little bit with his teacher, which is really nice.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Okay. Anyone else? How has technology been used in the pandemic? Yes, Parent 6. Oh, sorry. We were going to do Parent 5 first, and then we\\'ll get to Parent 6. Yeah.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOkay, I remember the first part of the question was how much technology they used before the pandemic, and my kids really didn\\'t use technology. They might have had computers once a week at school, but it was kind of like a fun class. So it was kind of a jump from nothing to full time technology. And then, what was the second part of your question? I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo then, did you have any concerns before? And then, how did that change during the pandemic, benefits or concerns?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI did have concerns before, because I\\'ve noticed especially my 10 year old has a really hard time transitioning away from technology, and kind of obsesses over wanting to check her email all the time, or see if somebody texted her back. And she doesn\\'t even have a real phone. It\\'s like an old Ipod that she can use as a phone. So for her, it\\'s been more negative, because she kind of gets stuck and wants to always be on a screen. The one day, she has a DOE Ipad, but the one day she somehow played Lego Friends for seven hours. Like I don\\'t know how it happened. I was working at home with her, but it just happened. So things like that were happening, that were concerning. That she was able to kind of circumvent whatever protection was supposed to be in place to keep kids focused on what they\\'re supposed to be doing during the school day.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nIt\\'s actually back, we\\'re in a better place now, because they\\'re back in school full time, or in the hybrid for one, but the others are in school. So they are using technology at school, but it\\'s more limited and there\\'s more kind of person to person contact, so it\\'s better now than when it was totally remote, like from last March until October.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. How has it been trying to manage their screen time, and kind of scale back, now that they are back in school?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nWe just have to be really strict, because even though it\\'s easy to say like, \"Okay fine, just do this one thing.\" Five minutes becomes, \"Oh, two more minutes.\" And it becomes an argument. So they really don\\'t have screen time during the week, unless it\\'s like a class they\\'re taking and they have to use it. And on the weekends, there\\'s more flexibility. But they\\'re doing different things now, and I\\'ve noticed she\\'s more into drawing now, or she\\'ll sit and make bracelets. I feel like her personality is just one that gets kind of sucked into screen, so once we took it away, it was helpful for her.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, thanks Parent 5. Parent 6, do you want to share?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSure. My main comment has less to do with amount of technology time, because my kids are a little bit older, not that that\\'s an excuse. But they\\'re going to be on social media for hours anyway. So, for me, being in school and using technology that way, sure it has increased the amount of screen time, but for me, what I\\'ve noticed, relatively anyway in our situation, is that school has, at least in my daughter\\'s case, she takes it a little bit less seriously. Or had been, when there is no teacher there. I mean, there is a teacher there, but it is just, as we all know, one more removed from responsibility, from accountability. You can so easily instant message your friend and ask what the answer is. Not that she does that, but I\\'m saying, it\\'s just wide open. There\\'s a lot more kind of on an honor system.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nAnd as a result, what I have seen is just less interest in school, and less commitment. And less accountability in general. So that\\'s a big negative. I however was one of the ones who raised my hand and said it\\'s overall positive, because I guess that\\'s a different question, but-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, no. I\\'m interested to hear the positives also now. Just really how technology has... How you\\'ve noticed it impact their education. But yeah, so...\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nRight. But I would say that this is what we had to do during this year, and my daughter would not have... I\\'m mainly talking about her right now. She would not have been able to get through the year without being able to communicate with friends that way. So any problems that I have seen over the past year, in terms of education, they just take such a second... They take a way back seat to me, to her mental health, and her... I don\\'t want her to fail, but at the same time, this is not normal times. Technology has made it possible for her to continue to go to school, but more important, to be with her friends. [crosstalk 00:19:38]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, so how does she engage with her friends through technology?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI mean, she Facetimes them all day long. She makes Tik Toks with them. She makes music with them. She draws with them. She watched Netflix with them. She has started a club completely using online, or remotely. So yeah. Also, I think dealing with your teachers only through email and tech has maybe even encouraged those relationships. I would say, in the past year. So those are all big positives to me, that outweigh some real negatives [inaudible 00:20:24] say. But yeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks for sharing that, Parent 6. Who wants to go next? Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo, my seven year old has been overloaded by Ipad usage. She\\'s been on hybrid learning, and that means that it\\'s been Ipads even when they\\'re in school. She has gone from a really happy, enthusiastic kid, to hating school and being kind of depressed. And I think a lot of that is the overuse of technology. I also raised my hand that there\\'s more pros, and that might be because I\\'m an optimistic person. But technology has made school possible, so I think that overall, it\\'s a positive thing.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy daughter is not drawn to technology. She\\'s at an age where, because she didn\\'t have a lot of technology before COVID, it\\'s not her default. So there are couple of things that she uses technology for, that she uses the internet for, but mostly she\\'s [inaudible 00:22:01] when it\\'s not school time.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So all of that extra Ipad use that you\\'re referring to is really for school purposes? And you\\'ve noticed it has [inaudible 00:22:13].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, there are a couple things that are not school use, like she watches maybe a movie once a month, and we are watching a television show that we watch about maybe another two hours a month. She goes through periods where she\\'ll do Duolingo. But it\\'s not really... She hasn\\'t done it for the last month. Yeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, okay. Thanks for sharing that, Parent 1. Who wants to go next? Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:23:04] So, both my kids have been part of the Healthy Brain Network study, and they\\'re both home right now. My 16 year old is... Before COVID, the school issued them a Chromebook, everybody gets a Chromebook. So it was something that they had kind of transitioned the kids to anyways, to [inaudible 00:23:33] turn it in, and checking online through Google Classroom for their work, and Power School and all that stuff. So they\\'ve always been very technology dependent at the school. And he would use... He\\'d be on the computer a lot anyways, because he loves computer games, and also he talks... But he won\\'t invite people over, but he\\'ll talk to his friends via Discord chat, or something, or online while they play these games.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed with him, that he was much more comfortable... This school is actually hybrid now if you want. He just got his first vaccine, he has really bad food allergies and asthma, so we were concerned about putting him back. Plus he has crazy anxiety, so him being at the... He went for a few days at hybrid school. His IEP manager thought it would be a good idea. But he just said it was so depressing, because the teacher, their attention was split between trying to sort of engage with the kids that were there in the classroom, and he\\'s like, \"And nobody wanted to be there.\" And also engage with the kids at home. So it\\'s very... I don\\'t envy the teachers, it\\'s a really difficult time.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSo he just said, \"I\\'d rather do school at home. Besides which, I can just do it in my pajamas. I don\\'t have to do anything.\" So he, in terms of using the computer now, he still is on the computer a lot, but he doesn\\'t... Like he actually said something really interesting the other day. He\\'s like, \"I started reading this online graphic novel, and I\\'m not playing as many games. Which is really crazy. I\\'m not playing as many games.\" And I was like, \"No, that\\'s great. You\\'re actually reading, you\\'re engaging.\"\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWith my older daughter, she actually went back to school because of COVID. She had taken a leave of absence and was working in the city. And she came home and was like, \"I might as well go back to school.\" And she\\'s been doing really, really well. I mean, but in terms of technology usage before and after, she\\'s 21, she\\'s always on her phone. My son really isn\\'t interested in social media. But she is obsessed. So when she\\'s not in class online, she\\'ll be making Tik Toks with her friends, or doing all that kind of, like as you were saying Parent 6, all those sort of things that I\\'m like, \"God, I\\'m old. I don\\'t understand anything.\" But she also sort of introduced us all to Jack Box games, so it\\'s like over Thanksgiving, we were able to spend time with out family who we would normally see, through these games and online through Zoom, like playing these games that are electronic games, that you can just have people sign into like you would Zoom.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSo it\\'s positive and negative. They\\'re isolating more. I can tell that... My son was like, he calls it fake school. I mean, he\\'s a sophomore this year, he hasn\\'t really had a real high school experience. So he doesn\\'t really know what\\'s going on. But he asked me, he\\'s like, \"Please don\\'t make me go back full time until next school year.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" Anyway. [crosstalk 00:26:53]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, no. No, you definitely did. It\\'s interesting to hear the perspective of older kids who were [inaudible 00:27:01] a little bit more before, and how it has been such a crazy change. And it seems like they\\'ve been able to moderate it [inaudible 00:27:11] self monitor themselves a little bit. Interesting. I mean, they\\'re older [inaudible 00:27:15]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHe also... Like I\\'ll have to tell him... There\\'s been times where he\\'s, after school, gone off and I\\'ve woken up in the middle of the night, and he\\'s on his computer playing games. I\\'m like, \"Dude, it\\'s 3:00 in the morning. You have school in the morning. What are you doing?\" He\\'s like, \"Oh, whoops.\" It\\'s hard to say no screens in your room, when that\\'s school.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, yeah. The boundaries are a little blurrier.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nI had a quick question. So for Parent 2, I think it was on Monday, I\\'m not sure Moderator 1 if you were in that focus group, but there was one particular focus group, where all the moms were telling us about Discord. And how it has such a negative impact on their child. They were talking about issues with cyber security, and the fact that schools have their children using Discord, but it has had a much more negative impact on their child. So Parent 2, of you, since you mentioned it, I wanted to know... And Moderator 1, I hope this is not like jumping the gun, but I just wanted to know, for you Parent 2, just your thoughts on Discord. Maybe because your son is older, compared to the other moms, if that is the reason why there\\'s a difference in how Discord is being used. Have you had any talks? And this is for all parents as well. Have you guys had any talks about cyber security with your kids, using social media or gaming and things like that?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, with my son definitely, because I think that a lot of the games that they play, they also have Discord chats. But he\\'s also had some negative experiences on Discord, where he actually saw somebody get killed. And he was so traumatized, and I said, \"Listen, I can\\'t police you 100% of the time. I\\'m not so much worried about you as what\\'s coming into your world via the screen. It\\'s not that I don\\'t trust you, I don\\'t trust other people.\" And I think he was so freaked out by seeing that, somebody had sent it up in one of their chats. I said, \"You know, you stay out of those. You stay out of unmoderated rooms. You stay out of rooms that are for over 18, because you\\'re 16. And just chat, only accept requests from people that you actually know in real life.\" Which he has done. I mean, at one point, there was somebody that was trying to talk to him. I\\'m like, \"You don\\'t know if this is a man or a woman. You have no idea if it\\'s actually a 14...\" This is when he was 14. \"A 14 year old kid, or if it\\'s like a 40 year old man.\" I\\'m like, \"So you need to just kind of be very aware.\"\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd again, with the anxiety, really that\\'s all it took, and he was like, \"Oh my God.\" I mean, I wasn\\'t trying to scare him, I was more warn him I guess. And sort of open his eyes. Like, \"Yeah, okay. You\\'re chatting with people, but you have no idea who you\\'re talking to.\" So yeah, there is pluses and minuses, but I think now that he\\'s older, he\\'s a little bit more savvy. He knows to kind of stay away from things that are really going to mess with his head. And cyber security, I mean Zoom isn\\'t... Like we\\'re on Zoom right now, guys. And it\\'s not all that secure. I do tell them to be aware, and don\\'t hand out information, and don\\'t tell people where you live, or don\\'t do those quizzes and all that stuff. But after a certain point, you can\\'t put the genie back in the bottle. Once the school has everybody online.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, it sounds like it\\'s something where you guys have definitely communicated about it. So Parent 3, I still want to hear from you, but I just want to hear if anyone else, does anyone else have comments about cyber security, or any experiences that you\\'ve had, or challenges with your children? Okay, so Parent 3, if you could share with us a little bit about [crosstalk 00:31:21]\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSure. So I would say before... Parent 4, do you have a comment about cyber security? Is that why you were thumbs up?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYou can go ahead. I can comment on that afterwards. Yeah. However you want to do it, yeah.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay. So my kids, I would say, were so sheltered from technology beforehand, that I like to tell that when my daughter was two or something, we were at a party where people were watching a football game, and I just remember feeling like I needed to shield the TV from her, because we just thought screen time was so bad. And she\\'s eight now, but she had really... She had watched movies with us, but barely ever used a computer. I mean, probably never independently before she had to kind of go to online learning. And we gave her a Chromebook. We gave our son a Chromebook.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd she has just... She\\'s just thrived. She\\'s in school five days a week now, but when she was doing remote school, she was very comfortable. Because I think navigating the physical world is a little difficult for her, it was more comfortable for her to communicate over Zoom. And she gave everyone tech help, and she\\'s learned to make videos and make slide shows. She\\'s gotten really into learning technology, in what I think is a very positive way.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd then my son, this year picked up chess, and he was able to do a lot of cool chess exercises on chesskid.com. I mean, another thing is that my daughter has never regularly woken up even at seven. Like she\\'s been waking up basically between 6:00 and 6:30 her whole life. And before, she would wake up me and my husband at that time, and it was very difficult for her to occupy herself until a time that we wanted to wake up on the weekends.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd now, she just... I mean, I don\\'t know if this is terrible. She watches videos for like an hour, or makes videos, or researches whatever she\\'s interested in. She\\'s learned to Google stuff, she\\'s learned to Google how to rotate her monitor. She\\'s just really into it, and we get to sleep in. And I mean, I guess sometimes there\\'s technology usage and we prefer that there wouldn\\'t be, but overall, I think the whole thing has been really positive. And now they\\'re back in school all the time, and I don\\'t know. I\\'m pretty happy that they\\'ve learned these skills, and honestly it\\'s a huge win for me and my husband to be able to sleep in on the weekends, and not be up at 6:30 every day.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat sounds great. Thank you for sharing, Parent 3. Yeah, that\\'s definitely something we\\'ve been hearing from a lot of parents, that it does serve that function of keeping your kids independent, for parents who need to work, or for parents who need to sleep. So yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, so the next part of thinking about how technology has impacted education that I\\'d like to talk about is, now that people are starting to return to school, or already have returned to school, what challenges do you anticipate in kind of adapting again, and reintegrating into a more normal schooling experience? Parent 6, yeah.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI would say I would have thought that my daughter... Again, I\\'ll talk about her, she\\'s 16... Would have been delighted to go back, would have been overjoyed to see her friends everyday, and have the normal high school experience again. But it\\'s really been mixed. For one thing, it\\'s exhausting sitting in class all day now. Getting dressed, going to school, having to navigate all the social stuff that she could block out before. So we\\'ve been talking a lot about it, about what is this... She\\'s not in school full time yet, just two days a week, but we\\'ve been talking a lot about what it\\'ll be like in the fall, when she has to go every day. She agrees that it hasn\\'t been 100% great. She\\'s even come home a couple times and said, \"I think I\\'ll go back to staying home.\" And she\\'s an extremely extroverted kid, so this is not like... That was a big surprise to me.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWhat aspects of it do you think have been challenging for her?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI think it\\'s the social, I think the having to be on all the time. I think she didn\\'t even realize it pre-pandemic, how exhausting that is. And I think as a high school kid, maybe even particularly a high school girl, where it really matters how people look at you and what they think about you. I have two boys, I know they would agree it\\'s the same for them. But yeah. I think just the sheer exhaustion of navigating the social stuff.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, it seems like she had a little break from that, and now going back, it\\'s hard.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nRight. Right.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnd sorry, now before we go on to challenges, I do just want to... Parent 4, I remember you had a comment about the cyber security.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOh, yes. Okay, thank you. So what I was just going to say is that I notice with my older son, who was in the Healthy Brain study, that he would get a lot texts about, \"Oh, this is a great job opportunity, click here.\" He was getting a lot more information that looked like it had cyber security concerns, than he ever got before. So I don\\'t know how that tied in with all of the Zoom school, and what\\'s going on with the pandemic, but it just seems like that was increasing. I mean, it increased for me, but it also increased for him, where he had never said he had that kind of problem before.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that\\'s interesting. It\\'s possible that people are taking advantage, knowing that people are online more than they ever were, and that also increases [inaudible 00:39:01] and stuff like that. Okay, so does anyone else want to comment on challenges? Going back to school. Parent 5, yes?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYes, this is sort of similar to what Parent 6 was saying. I thought my kids would be thrilled to be back in school. And my 12 year old is really not. She still is giving us a lot of pushback about how she got more work done at home. I think she liked the independence, so she could finish her work, and then sit and read. Like it was just... Her day was less stressful, in the sense that she had a lot more free time built into it.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nMy younger two, the 10 year old and five year old, I think they thought it would be like it was in the past at school, but there\\'s so many rules now, and at recess they\\'re supposed to stick with their pods, so they can\\'t see other friends. So stuff like that has been a challenge. And I think socially, it\\'s hard especially for my 10 year old, because she is kind of in this one group of kids, and it\\'s not a chance to mix with different kids, there\\'s not different personalities. So that\\'s really been a challenge. I mean, I think it\\'ll get better as more people are coming back, but yeah. I thought it would be rainbows and so exciting, but it has been pretty stressful for everyone still.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 5. Anyone else?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. Hi, it\\'s Parent 4. [crosstalk 00:40:25] I chose a hybrid schedule for both of my sons, because I knew that if they were home full time, the transition would be intense once they went back to a full time schedule. So they\\'re used to being out and about, and so to them, their schedule hasn\\'t changed, because both of their schools have hybrid schedule. One of my sons, my youngest son\\'s school only has a hybrid schedule. My oldest son\\'s school, I think they do have a full time schedule, but even with the hybrid schedule, there are so few students in class, that it wouldn\\'t make sense for him to have a full time schedule. And I didn\\'t want to make him feel he had to do that, when his brother wasn\\'t.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI\\'m hoping that they will both ease into the full time schedule, when that becomes the routine, hopefully in September. But I don\\'t see, I don\\'t really believe it will be a difficult situation. They\\'re very active, so they are always out. They like to move and interact with their peers, and just be social. So I\\'m hoping the transition back to a full time schedule will be somewhat seamless.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks, Parent 4. Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy daughter\\'s been in school, hybrid, since October. So as things are opening up, they have gone back. They went from two classrooms to one classroom per class. And so, now that she\\'s back in one class, I thought she would be happier to be in school, because there was less Ipad usage. But I think that she is just really down on school, and I\\'m not sure when that\\'s going to change.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you\\'re seeing some leftover effects still, from being at home. So it didn\\'t just go back. Anyone else have anything they\\'d like to share, about [inaudible 00:43:03] you anticipate, about as things start to go back to normal? Okay. So I think the last topic that I was hoping to discuss is to maybe shift away from the education focus a little bit, and I know people have brought up internet usage and social media usage through some of the other discussions. But thinking about... First of all, it seems like a few people here have been able to regulate usage, and haven\\'t seen it turn into really taking over your kids lives. So maybe if you guys could share a little bit about how you\\'ve been able to regulate your kids\\' usage, and how you were able to keep technology to be a pretty positive experience for some of you. And then, also if you have any other concerns or benefits related to kind of internet usage, then I\\'d like to hear that as well. Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI don\\'t know how to... I mean, in terms of limiting internet usage, I mean on his phone, I\\'m able to block a bunch of stuff, like sites and stuff like that, and also set timers. I have a program on his phone. But on his computer, it takes him forever to do his homework, my son. So I don\\'t know if turning off the internet at 10 for him is a viable thing, because sometimes he\\'s still doing homework then. And so, I wish there was a way, I wish I knew of a way to be, \"Don\\'t become Ted Kazinski. Get out of your room. Go outside. You need vitamin D.\" It helps that we have a dog, a fairly young dog that he plays with and walks. As everybody was saying, he doesn\\'t want to go back to school. He hates school he says. He does well, the teachers like him. It\\'s not that. It\\'s just he doesn\\'t like school. I think because socially... He has friends, but he has a lot of anxiety. And so he sort of takes everything in.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut I wish I knew how to be better at limits. We say, \"Come downstairs. Come see us. Let\\'s do something.\" I mean, even if it\\'s watching a movie together, it\\'s like, \"Let\\'s play a game, let\\'s do something. Let\\'s go for a walk. Please help me do this with the yard.\" And he\\'ll do it. And so will my older one. But yeah, I don\\'t know. And in terms of, I don\\'t know if you saw the chat thing I sent-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYes, I did. Yeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIn some respects, the teacher, that really made me mad. I mean, I am concerned that he\\'s sharing basically this screen with Twitter. And he took down, but then he blocked the kid, which I get it. You don\\'t need to be able to read a teacher\\'s personal tweets. But he shouldn\\'t be posting that. And so, we\\'re going to definitely have a conversation with the school about him violating privacies. But I was encouraged that my son was really angry about that. So knowing that there was an issue with people sharing his likeness and his name online. So, that\\'s [inaudible 00:46:58].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, no. That\\'s definitely an issue to spotlight. Parent 4, you want to say something?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOh yes. I forgot to take that hand down from before [crosstalk 00:47:12]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, it\\'s okay.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nBut I do want to say... I don\\'t regulate it anymore. Because in the beginning last year, when we were on lockdown, it was really their only form of socializing and communicating with their friends. And it just seemed, because it went on for so long, by the time I saw the need to kind of regulate stuff, the train was out of the station. What I do, because the place they [inaudible 00:47:50] is in the living room, that I try and regulate a little bit. So I\\'ll spend most of my time in the living room. And they don\\'t want to play with the PlayStation if I\\'m there. There\\'s not much else that I can really do to regulate it. They do a lot of talking to their friends on their phone. So I\\'m okay with that. I\\'m okay with that. And that\\'s just how we moved forward.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy younger son has sort of started to regulate things more for himself. But my oldest son has always spent a lot of time on his phone, meeting with his friends in the group chats and things like that. It\\'s not different that he does it, it\\'s just the amount of time. And again, although we\\'re not on lockdown, his ability to socialize to the extent that he would like to, is still somewhat limited. So I just give him leeway with that.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah. No, that makes sense Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI would say that for our kids, at some point I realized my son was like playing chess puzzles and math games, whatever games that his class had introduced him to, a lot after finishing his school work. And then I just made sure that he knew that I was totally available for him. Like if he wanted to play Legos, if he wanted to read a book with me or something. And I think just... And I\\'ve noticed that he kind of doesn\\'t do well... Again, this week is literally their first day of being in school five days a week, but he was home three days a week this whole time. And I just notice that he stopped doing that, and he would just come seek me out. And I think also our kids are young enough, that we can just shut their laptops. We can just shut it down, and they\\'ll just move on with the rest of their lives.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nLike I think, for me, it\\'s like when the pandemic began, I really didn\\'t want to set limits on technology time, because I thought that would create the impression that technology was this amazing thing, and it was like your parents were just trying to keep you away from it, because obviously it\\'s the best thing, and it\\'s such a punishment to not be able to use it. And instead, just kind of make sure that everything else was still totally available, and I found that our kids choose that most of the time, when it\\'s available.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that\\'s an interesting point, and I think also what you were saying, that you still, because they\\'re so young, you still can have complete control and just shut it down or take it away. And they don\\'t independently control it. Okay. So anybody have any other thoughts that we didn\\'t discuss, or any insights into how it\\'s impacted your kids, or thoughts for how we\\'re going to move forward? Yeah, Parent 6?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nWith older kids, again, I have almost no control over their technology. So I\\'m listening to these stories wistfully, because I would love to take away laptops, and even put programs on their computers or phones. As you said Parent 4, I think that train\\'s left the station years ago, way pre-pandemic. But I also think that what\\'s worked somewhat, a little bit, a tiny bit for us in the past, and I\\'m going to try to push going forward, is just to do the most obvious, basic thing, which is keeping as busy as possible. With other things. And whether that\\'s chores, which is not a desirable thing, but get a job, or just push activity. And if possible, it would involve us too. Like actual fun family things. But that\\'s not really what teenagers want to do, at least in my experience.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:52:40] time with us, but I know people who have done that. Who have just kept their kids incredibly busy in whatever way they can. And everything else has kind of taken care of itself, including technology, and really a bunch of other things too. They kind of all fall into place if the kids are just too busy to get bored.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. No, theoretically, that sounds like a very good idea. I think [inaudible 00:53:13] a lot of activities have been limited or not available, but going forward, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, so I just want to thank you all so much for taking some time to join us. This has been a really great group, and your insights are really helpful to us. And we really appreciate you spending the time with us. So I\\'m going turn it over to Administrator just to close it out. But it was really nice meeting you all. Thank you.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi everyone. So just like Moderator 1 said, thank you guys so much for the information that you guys gave us today. This group was definitely different from the other groups that we\\'ve had, just because like I mentioned before, a lot of parents had been talking about their difficulties that they\\'ve faced throughout the pandemic, and their child\\'s internet usage. So the information that you guys gave us is definitely helpful with what we\\'re trying to do. Which is not only just do research, but to host a town hall meeting where we can provide resources to those who are having difficulties, and even to those who aren\\'t facing difficulties. So we really appreciate all the insight that you guys gave us today.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIn regards to compensation, you should receive it no later than Friday. It comes via email, it\\'s an Amazon gift card. So if you don\\'t receive it by Friday, please do not hesitate to reach out to me, and we can get that situated.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right, thank you all. Have a great rest of your afternoon. So nice to see you.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you, bye-bye.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nBye-bye.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nBye.'b'Parent 1:\\n\\n(silence) Hello.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi there, how are you?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m doing well. Do you want my camera on?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSo you can leave it off for right now and then once everybody joins on, then you can turn on your camera.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay, no problem.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nI\\'m going to mute my mic as well, but once everybody comes on, then I\\'ll reintroduce myself.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay, sounds good, thanks (silence).\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHi (silence).\\n\\n\\tHi. [Administrator 00:11:45], I know you are on. Who else is on?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSo, we have Parent 1. I am getting a call from another parent, give me...\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nParent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes, hi.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHi. I\\'m going to give it one more minute and then we might have to reschedule if the other parents aren\\'t showing up.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, okay.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI am so sorry (silence).\\n\\n\\tAdministrator?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi Moderator 2.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI think we\\'re going to wrap. Oh. Is anyone else going to join?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah, I was just on the phone with a parent. Another parent is supposed to be joining, she said she got the link and she was signing on. I\\'ll call her again right now just to see if she\\'s still able to sign on if you want.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI guess, okay. But we\\'re going to get started and we\\'ll do this quickly. It won\\'t take as long because there\\'s not as many people. So, hi everyone. Hold on a second, trying to load something. Thank you for agreeing to participate today. I am sorry that we are starting late, but as you know, there were not people on earlier. This is a short-ish focus group. I have a couple of questions that I want to talk to you about, but before we get started, why don\\'t you tell me your name and about your child who participated in this study?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMe?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOh, okay. My name is Parent 2 and my eight-year-old daughter, Parent 2, Child 1, participated in the Healthy Brain Study because I wanted to participate in the study because I felt my daughter has ADHD. And once she went through the whole process and everything, it was diagnosed, she was diagnosed with ADHD and they suggested that I put her on medication and try different methods when it comes to her attention deficit, right? Because that\\'s what it is, it\\'s attention deficit. And she\\'s hyper, so it\\'s both. I have not put her on medication as of yet because at the time when all this was going on, the pandemic started and kind of put a hold on a lot of things.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nParent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi, my name is Parent 1. I had actually two of my children participate in the study. Parent 1, Child 1, she was nine at the time, and Parent 1, Child 2, who was eight at the time. Parent 1, Child 1 was diagnosed with ADHD. We actually already saw a neurologist and we kept the medication the same. With Parent 1, Child 2, we had a diagnosis of ADHD and anxiety, which explained a lot, it helped us deal more with her behavioral problems because it was very different than Parent 1, Child 1\\'s. But we didn\\'t put Parent 1, Child 2 on any medication. Honestly, because with COVID, it was hard. Both of the kids were at home studying remotely and they both have paras in school, so they have a lot of support in their school environment currently.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. So I just want to learn a little bit about what the experience of using technology before and during COVID was like for you. If you each can just tell me more about how your children used technology for educational purposes prior to the pandemic. Was it beneficial? Did you have problems with it? This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, I know, it was a long time. It was, well, nearly 18 months now, right?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWell, before COVID, obviously they were going to school in the day instead of being home all day, so technology use was very limited. It was more our school uses a system called i-Ready for reading and math, so a lot of the homework was done through that. It\\'s more like extra support, it\\'s a diagnostic tool as well, and they used it this year as well. But it\\'s basically, in school, they would do the diagnostic to see what level the kids are in math and reading, and then after that, at home, they basically, on their own pace, they had to do a certain amount of i-Ready a day, a week, it depended on the teacher, but it was between 30 minutes, or 40 minutes, or it could have been an hour a week in total. Each teacher did it differently. But that was really the only technological usage at home.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. Parent 2, you\\'re muted.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOh, sorry about that. I\\'m going to say the same for my daughter. Prior to the pandemic, technology wasn\\'t used that much unless it was to play games on the tablet or, I don\\'t know, watch YouTube Kids or something like that. But throughout the pandemic and the remote learning, it was a lot of technology usage this year. I don\\'t want to say that it helped. I think that in-person is much better than any technology offered, honestly, for so many different reasons. But I feel like the kids, they tend to get sucked into the tablets and the technology and then they forget about everything else going on around them.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAnd what were they using technology for during the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSchool, school. And school and other activities, like I said, whether it was to play games or watch-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:20:23] trouble with it?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNo. I wouldn\\'t say it was... It was hard to get her to stay focused during the class time, even though it was a short amount of time. She was in class from about 8:00 to 11:30 every day and it was a little hard to keep her focused. Just to sit in front of a iPad for that amount of time, it was a bit hard to keep her focused on that.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWhat about you Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, our kids were full remote, so they were on technology from 8:00, about 8:30 in the morning, to about 2:00 every day, it depended on the school schedule. So they had things throughout the day, so I think they had about, on average, two and a half hours of live meetings on Zoom or Google Meets with the teacher or in small groups. And some time was given for i-Ready, which they kept using remotely. Some time was also asynchronous work, so to complete some worksheet or some kind of like... They also used, I think Pearson owns it, Savvas for their math. So they did that. The only real issue we had with technology was some of the apps didn\\'t always work. So initially, we had the kids on the iPad and we noticed that the iPad wasn\\'t as compatible with some of the programs, so it was very frustrating, so we switched them to a computer, a PC, each.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd also the parental controls on the PC because I\\'ve noticed that my daughters kept flipping back and forth because we had to have things like YouTube open because the teachers would use it in school and the kids would just watch YouTube for hours and hours and hours or they would play games like Minecraft and flip through it. So once we were onto it, we could ban or block certain things, but it wasn\\'t easy because they were on technology all the time and it was six hours of that or seven hours of that. I felt like my older daughter did better, she\\'s a little bit more self-reliant in her personality, so people distract her, so compared to school, she was really advanced and she finished really early and she did a lot more enrichment. My younger daughter, she struggled a lot more keeping focused, she needed almost like that physical school environment because she was distracted by the technology, all the apps that were on the computer.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. And have your children returned to school full-time yet?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nNot yet, they will in September. The school announced that it\\'s going to be physical now, schooling.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWhat challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI personally think it\\'s going to be hard, it\\'s going to be a transition. They have to get back adapted to the structure and the rules and the being in the class for so many hours. Just waking up in the morning, getting dressed, leaving. I think they\\'re going to have to get used to all that all over again, so. And as far as the teachers, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what to tell them, I commend them though because I know it\\'s going to be hard, you know.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s funny because I\\'m actually a teacher, I teach high school, so it\\'s been hard, the remote. So there\\'s certain things I liked being a teacher remote versus in the classroom. But my older daughter, she\\'s moving into middle school, so the transition shouldn\\'t be too... She\\'s already transitioning, so I feel like, for her, it will be easier. But my younger daughter, because she\\'s continuing elementary school, I think she\\'s going to have more of an issue with that structure. You need the bathroom at home, you just get up and go.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nRight, mm-hmm (affirmative).\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nFood is better at home, those little things. She also got annoyed with other students when students would act inappropriately on the chat or call out. And I noticed that was the one frustration with the remote because she\\'s like, \"I can\\'t believe [inaudible 00:25:25] is talking over the teacher.\" So I\\'m wondering if that\\'s going to be a frustration more in the environment because that\\'s something that\\'s even... You have a lot of controls online, you can turn off chat, you can silence students, mute everybody.\\n\\n\\tBut she does have a para physically, so I think that\\'s going to also help her because this year, because the para was also remote, it was all phone conversations. And I think she almost needed that physical organization. And I also think handwriting, everything was typed, everything was recorded, Flipgrid or anything else. But the kids didn\\'t really write for 14 months, they didn\\'t hold a pen for 14 months, so that\\'s another transition. There\\'s certain things, like the state tests, unless you have an accommodation where you have that writing accommodation, which we might really go for, but the idea that you don\\'t even think about these things or the remote situation hinders it.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWell, my kids, they did some writing. I would have to go to the school, pick up books for them, and things like that, so. I mean, because I have a kindergartner, he was in kindergarten, and then I have my daughter who participated in the program. My son didn\\'t participate in the program, my daughter\\'s the one who participated. But dealing with them both doing this remote thing, my son didn\\'t even get to start at the big school, as we call it, yet, so.\\n\\n\\tBut my daughter, she had all her IEP, she had speech therapy, she had extra special ed, I guess, it\\'s special classes, special, extra alone time with a specific teacher that just works with her individually because of the ADHD. And if they had been in school for this school year, she would have got a lot of in-person time with whoever she needed to. But because it was remote, I feel like she probably didn\\'t get as much time with everybody as she should have. So I\\'m excited that they\\'ll be going back in September so that they can get the hours that they need, that they really need, or that they should have gotten this year but they didn\\'t.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nDo you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children\\'s technology use was like during quarantine?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nFor me, I think the challenge and the thing that is more concerning is the emotional and psychological and self-esteem. I\\'m a single mom, I only have one child, but what I notice in general, and he\\'s going on fifth grade, and he can\\'t wait to go in person. But I think the curriculum and many other things, we can support them, but there\\'s a part of them emotionally that I hope they have enough understanding and empathy around them to make them feel safe enough to express how they feel. That, to me, it\\'s been one of my biggest concern.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, I agree. It was very isolating for the kids. I mean, I\\'m lucky that the girls are so close together because they have each other to talk to, but they\\'re still siblings, so they miss their friends. They were very isolated from other kids. So just even that interaction, even talking to other people. And I don\\'t know about the long-term health effects too because I noticed that Parent 1, Child 2 did this weird blinking thing by the end of the school year with her eyes. And I\\'m like, \"Is that anxiety? Is that eye strain?\" But I cut them off technology after the school year was over and it seemed to go away, so I\\'m wondering if it\\'s just that intense... When they\\'re staring on the computer screen, they don\\'t take breaks like adults. Adults might say, \"All right, I\\'m doing this, I\\'m writing this email, I\\'m going to take a 15-minute break.\" The kids are just on it for seven hours straight, they\\'re eating lunch in front of the screen.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, that regulation wasn\\'t there. So definitely, that\\'s that problem too. It was more like, \"We did school, now we want to go and watch YouTube or play Minecraft.\" But it\\'s like, \"You were on technology for six hours, you\\'re on it for two more hours, are you kidding me?\"\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWhat are your kids doing for this summer?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, we\\'re actually traveling across the country. We\\'re in Minnesota right now, we\\'ve been doing a road trip. So we left the tablets home. I only have my laptop and my phone to take pictures and the computer to book hotels and watch Netflix, but that\\'s it. It is complete cold turkey and they haven\\'t asked for it. The only technology they have is, I got them Kindles, so they\\'re reading a lot, which is [crosstalk 00:31:10]. So we\\'re going to keep that, that form of technology, but the Kindle is like a book, you can\\'t do anything else on it.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s great.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSo, I have a question and I don\\'t know if this is part of the conversation, there\\'s an incognizance for how our childrens are going to deal when the new year starts and how all this emotions and stress and anxiety may hit. And a lot of families don\\'t have sometimes the opportunities, for example, to travel like that. And they still at home, they still in the city. How can we support childrens as we sort of moving into \"our new normality,\" but the childrens under 12 are the most at risk right now, not only for this new virus and all of this, but also the emotional?\\n\\n\\tAnd I think we\\'ve been all living in a certain bubble, and yesterday, I got on the subway for the first time, and the subway got stuck in one part, and I literally, for the first time, I thought I was going to have a panic attack. So I\\'m thinking, I\\'m an adult and I\\'m able to control because I am a Buddhist, I meditate, I have tools. But I just got on the subway not even thinking how it\\'s going to hit me. And I kept thinking about how childrens are going to feel and act when they go back to school and how can we support them without putting too much our own anxiety into them? I feel like childrens in many way have been my second heroes after nurses and doctors because they\\'ve been more resilient and more empathetic with this than sometimes the adults. But my concern is how we moving forward and how can we support them and catch little things to give them the tools or at least support?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWell, I don\\'t have answers for you.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNo, maybe somebody has an idea or maybe somebody else has been thinking the same thing as me, I\\'m just sharing.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI mean, I certainly would recommend you come to the town hall where we talk about the results of this and maybe some suggestions there will be helpful for you. I think supporting your kids is doing the best you can do, right? So-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBecause during this year, for example, I put my kid in this acting classes on Zoom because he\\'s a fan of [Dogman 00:33:57] and I found this remote acting class and it was great. We go on the bike, we take walks, we read every day, a real book, for 20 minutes, I sit with him, one page him, one page me. I try to do anything that I can, but we\\'ve been in this bubble that we all have build the best that we can. It\\'s like, what\\'s going to happen in September?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI think those-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWell, I think-\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, I\\'m sorry. Oh, I was going to say because I also have a teacher\\'s perspective and I think that\\'s why I left the city because we\\'re avoiding cities, we\\'re in the country, the kids are complaining about bugs. We\\'re like, \"We haven\\'t seen so many moths come out.\" But it\\'s part of the fun. But I think with kids being resilient in these [inaudible 00:34:53] September, it has to be a community working with the school and having a plan because I know they were pushing the social, emotional piece within my school and within the kids\\' school, so that has to continue. And it has to be a community effort because that\\'s the bubble we\\'re in, that\\'s the pod we\\'re in with those people, and how can we support each other.\\n\\n\\tAnd I think also tone down the fear, I know the variant... I mean, I follow the news. The variant is scary, but just seeing life in the Midwest, people here are completely different than the city. I know it\\'s a smaller population, the town we\\'re in right now, it\\'s like 1,500 people, but people are just living their lives, the kids are just running around. So it\\'s interesting to see the different perspectives. And I think part of it is because we\\'re from New York and we have so many people that live around us, so any outbreak is a lot more serious than in the Midwest. But it\\'s just like, has this also consumed our lives to the point that we\\'re not even living?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI also think it\\'s important to remind children that they are safe, that even if they are not vaccinated and under 12, that the overwhelming likelihood of what we know about the virus is that it will impact them very minimally. So reducing fear, having open conversations, is going to help your children adapt to going back to school and being in an open environment.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI agree with that.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nBut if you want more suggestions, I would definitely recommend coming to the town hall when we\\'re done so that you can hear... All the study information. Does anyone else have anything they want to add? All right, well, we will wrap up then. Administrator, do you want to go over compensation?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYes. So first, thank you all so much for participating in the focus group today. Once this is over, I will be sending over your emails to our administrator. You should receive compensation no later than Friday, so if by Friday you don\\'t receive any compensation, please do not hesitate to either email me or give me a call and we\\'ll get that sorted out. And just to reiterate what Moderator 2 said, we are compiling all of this information to host a town hall meeting before September. So once we have that finalized, I\\'ll be reaching out to you guys for that information. We will be sharing some resources and some tips just based on the information that we collected from the focus groups and from the surveys that you guys completed, some different strategies and tools that might be helpful for both you and your children to navigate just this COVID lifestyle and education and all the things that you guys have raised concerns about.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nGreat, thank you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThank you all so much.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThank you very much everybody.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nIt was very nice to hear the concerns, it makes also I think parents feel like we\\'re not alone, so thank you for sharing.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you.'b'Moderator 1:\\n\\n(silence) \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n\\tHi, everyone. We\\'re just waiting for Moderator 1, our clinician, and then the other parents to hop on, and then we\\'ll get started.\\n\\n\\t(silence)\\n\\n\\tHi, everyone. Hi, Parent 1. Hi, Parent 2. Thanks so much for joining. We\\'re just going to wait a few minutes for another few people to come and then we can get started\\n\\n\\t(silence) \\n\\n\\tHi, Parent 3. Thanks for coming. We\\'re just waiting for one or two more people to join, but we\\'ll get started in a couple minutes.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay, I just have to address something with the kids. I\\'ll be right back.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. No problem. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:06:49] For the Zoom?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 4. Can you hear us okay? Okay. I think we\\'re actually all here for now. One other person might join us but we can get started before she comes. And then if she comes, she can join us. Thank you, everyone, for making some time today to do this with us. We really appreciate getting to hear from you. The reason why we\\'re doing this is to follow up to the crisis survey that you had all filled out and just get a deeper understanding of specific issues that families have been facing during COVID-19 specifically related to technology. \\n\\n\\tBefore we get started, I think it would be nice if maybe we just go around and have a quick icebreaker. Just, let\\'s say, introduce ourselves, maybe say the ages of your kids, and one TV show or movie that you recommend that you\\'ve seen over the past year. I can go first. My name is Moderator 1. I\\'m the clinical training and assessment manager of the Healthy Brain Network. One TV show that I\\'ve really gotten into recently is Good Girls. It\\'s a good mix of funny and suspenseful. It\\'s about three housewives who get involved in crime. I recommend it. Who wants to go next? Hi, Parent 5. Go ahead. I\\'m glad that she ... All right, Parent 3, you want to go next?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi. My name is Parent 3. I have an 11-year-old and a nine-year-old. Although some days, it feels like I have 20 kids as opposed to just two. A good show, let me see. Well, I\\'m a fan of Sex in the City, but I\\'ve been watching that ad nauseum. But the Queen\\'s Gambit actually is a great show and you know ...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, thanks Parent 3. Parent 1, do you want to now?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m Parent 1. I have a 12-year-old, and I really enjoyed The Good Place.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWait, how old is your kids? Sorry, I miss that.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n12 years old, going on 20.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWho wants to go next? Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Parent 2. My son is now 20. And Yellowstone, I got really into Yellowstone. It\\'s a soap opera, western. [inaudible 00:10:13].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat can\\'t be bad. I haven\\'t heard of that one but I sure like Kevin Costner. Okay, who\\'s next?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi, good afternoon everyone. My name is [Parent 4 00:10:29]. My boy is 13, going to 14. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNice to meet you, Parent 4. Okay. Parent 5? I think you\\'re on mute. I\\'m not sure if you can hear us.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nMe?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, Parent 5.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nModerator 1, another parent is going to be joining in the next couple of minutes.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So we\\'re going to have six today?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Cool. Parent 5, I\\'m not sure if your audio is working. But if you can figure out how to unmute, then just speak up and introduce yourself. Okay? Before we get started with the discussion, I want to first do an exercise. So if everyone could just grab a paper and pen or something to write on nearby, and just take a few minutes and think about what are two or three positive ways that technology has impacted your child over the past year-and-a-half? And what are two or three negative ways that technology has impacted your child? If you could just jot down a couple of thoughts and then we\\'ll discuss. \\n\\n\\t(silence)\\n\\n\\tHi, Parent 5. We saw you there for a minute.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nGreat. Sorry. Just having some technical difficulties trying to connect so hello.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo worries. Hi. Welcome. Thanks so much for joining.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThanks for having me.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIf you want to introduce yourself quickly?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nSure. My name Parent 5. And what else do are we saying? I have a ... Go ahead.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAge of your child.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI have a recent 12-year-old who just turned 12 on Wednesday. Who are 12, six, and four. So thank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNice. And if you have a recommendation for a TV show or a movie that you\\'ve watched over the pandemic you can share with us?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nA TV show that I\\'ve watched over the pandemic? Grey\\'s Anatomy. I mean, does it have to be specific to the kids or I mean ...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThis is just my way of getting recommendations of things to watch and getting [inaudible 00:13:47].\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOkay. What does it call it? I mean Grey\\'s Anatomy and a couple of spin-offs that they had. They really were doing a really good job of kind of re-enacting what\\'s been going on in the world with COVID and the Black Lives Matter movement. So those were, I mean, what I\\'ve been focused on over the COVID time.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNice. Okay. Thank you. We\\'re just taking a couple of minutes now to just write down a couple of positive ways that technology has impacted your child over the pandemic, and also a couple of negative ways that technology has impacted your child. After you do that, after you jot down a couple, I\\'d like you to circle whichever one has had the biggest overall impact, the good or the bad. And then we\\'ll talk.\\n\\n\\t(silence)\\n\\n\\tBy show of hands, who circled the negative group as having the bigger impact over since the pandemic? All right, so Parent 2, you think that the negative has a bigger impact, Parent 3 also, and Parent 1. Parent 4 and Parent 5, would you say that the negative or a positive has had a bigger impact overall?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI will say both.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So you\\'re kind of in the middle. Parent 5, what do you say ...\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI was going to say the same. For me, it\\'s both.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. All right. I wanted to get everyone thinking about it. And also, I think this really highlights that there\\'s definitely good and bad impacts of technology. And we want to spend some time digging in on both sides of the issue. I just also really want to encourage everyone to share your specific perspective, because I know that a lot of people\\'s experiences overlap. And then also people have their own unique experiences. So feel free to contrast what someone else says or agree or whatever your experience has been. The first question that I would like to discuss is, how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? And did you find technology for educational purposes beneficial before the pandemic? Did you have any concerns before the pandemic? Whoever wants to share first can go. Anyone can jump in. Parent 5?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nMy son goes to our charter school. Before the pandemic, he was using computers to do most of his work at home. But it was really just about schoolwork. So it wasn\\'t doing anything above and beyond that. And I think your question was also what was after, right?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, we\\'ll move into that. If it relates to what you\\'re saying now, you can definitely do. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI\\'ll wait. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. It seems like he was using it a little bit for school before, but it was pretty contained at the charter school that he was at?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGot you. Did you have any concerns or do you find it beneficial in terms of technology and education?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI definitely found that it was beneficial because he was able to access more materials. When I think of school books, I don\\'t know, an Encyclopedia Britannica just always pops into my head. I\\'m like, at least you don\\'t have to walk around with this large book, but now you have access to all of that content and much more. That\\'s kind of the framework that I\\'ve always been able to use. But I didn\\'t feel like he understood that at that time. Being able to go on Google and just search, I mean, it wasn\\'t something that he really understood at the time.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHe probably don\\'t appreciate how amazing that is compared to books.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, anyone else experience with ... Yup, Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIt was pretty minimal for school. It was mostly, I mean, they did use some Chromebooks for some projects at school that they share. She was in a public school, she still is. But overall, the use of the computer was mostly to do research, for project-based stuff. And punctually to, I mean, in fifth grade more than in sixth, strangely enough, there\\'s a lot of use of Google Class, submitting essays, and things like that, but it was still very minimal.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Who wants to go now?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy child also had access to the computer before the pandemic at school. He also learned [inaudible 00:19:59] at school. It was somewhat minimal. What I love then was that he would come back home, and use the computer for his assignment and most of his thing, and then he was more confident using the computer than writing. And I was trying to get him an access or get the accommodation for assistive technology for him all through the pandemic. And while working, they had to evaluate him and saw that it was more better for him to be on the computer, to use computer for his academic work more at school because it wasn\\'t restricted somehow with the use of computer at school.\\n\\n\\tBut when he got home, he did everything on the computer. And also, not just for academic work, he also did it for his games and every other thing. But when he transitioned to remote learning now, he\\'s also gained confidence, independence in using everything on the computer. So that\\'s why I say it\\'s half-half. The other half is no. It\\'s complete reliance on the computer. Now you can\\'t get him off it, you can\\'t tell him to stop. You give him a time, he [inaudible 00:21:23].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo now it\\'s really hard to regulate that?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYes. They will scream and shout. One time he stays until 2:00 AM on the computer trying to [inaudible 00:21:37] and do it ...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s hard. It sounds like from before the pandemic, that you noticed that technology was very beneficial for him in order to be able to express himself without the fine motor demands of writing, and you had actually worked into technology. So that part probably was a nice transition for him in gaining confidence but just it kind of went overboard. So we\\'ll go more into that. Anyone else want to share? Parent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nMy son before the pandemic was mostly iPad for his ... He had an accommodation. So he would use the iPad occasionally, but nothing crazy. I mean, nothing obsessive. Since the pandemic, it has gone to zero to 100. As soon as they closed the school down, as soon as de Blasio said, \"School\\'s closing,\" it literally went from zero to 100. It\\'s just like he\\'s obsessed with it. Very similar experiences to Parent 4. He does not want to get off of it. It is a constant fight. It is a constant battle of putting in appropriate guidelines. It is a push and shove it. I feel bad some days because I\\'m like, \"You can\\'t use it except only for school.\" But then at the same time because of the pandemic, that\\'s how he socializes a lot of time with his friends. So it\\'s almost like, \"Well, do I punish him by taking away the one thing he really holds most dear to his heart? But then if I do that, I take away his ability to socialize with his friends.\"\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt makes it particularly hard to kind of ...\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nRight. It\\'s a very tough seat. I\\'m like on a seesaw. It\\'s constancy seesaw, it\\'s a constant weighing the pros and the cons. He\\'s a high functioning ASD. He\\'s got essentially Asperger\\'s and ADHD so he gets hyper-focused and very upset very easily if his hyper focus if it\\'s cut off.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. So it\\'s particularly hard for him to transition out of it.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah. No matter how many minutes, no matter how many stop watches, countdowns, the whole nine, it\\'s very trying. That\\'s why I have these bands.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 2, you want to share with us what ...\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSure. My son\\'s older through all these kids, but he\\'s still trying to get his diploma from high school. He had a lot of issues on top of the ADD, he had some depression, and PTSD. We recently moved out to Maine. So now we\\'re out of New York City and we\\'re in the country. When he was in New York City and school\\'s opened, being accepted to use the computer to hand in assignments, answer emails from teachers, that kind of thing. So he spends a lot of his time on the computer with gaming.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt says prior to the pandemic.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nRight, prior to. Technology has always been his thing. One, I think it just gives him something to do. That takes his brain away from everything else that\\'s going on in his life. But school-wise, there was in-person learning so he didn\\'t ... The transition to in-person learning, I mean, strictly computer learning has been difficult with him because he\\'s actually a social kid. I think so beforehand, so when the pandemic first started, he was like, \"This is awesome, because I\\'m an introvert and now I don\\'t happen to see people.\" [inaudible 00:25:58] really quick. Now a lot of his stuff is he communicates with school and teachers and advisers, friends. I mean, again, there\\'s a lot of online gaming that he does and he actually even streams movies and television and stuff.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHave you noticed that becoming more concerning and problematic, or it\\'s always been hard for him to regulate that?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s always been hard for him to regulate that. Now that he is an adult and taller and stronger than I am, it\\'s hard for me to kind of step in. I can\\'t move on or just physically take it away from him.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThe level of your child is much harder now.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nRight. He has a job, which has helped. That\\'s gotten him out of the house.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo being able to go out is definitely key. So that actually leads to the next question. So the next question is how did your child\\'s use of technology for school purposes changed during the pandemic? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns or find it problematic? Parent 4 and Parent 3 and Parent 2, I think you guys kind of shared that it\\'s been that way. But Parent 1 and Parent 5, I\\'d like to hear from you guys a little bit about how things changed in terms of was it beneficial? Was it problematic? Whoever wants to go first? Parent 1, go for it.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI don\\'t know. It\\'s been ... I mean, because she was remote for a certain time ... I mean, it was horrible.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIt started well. And then it went to [inaudible 00:28:05] so much more that ... I mean, with her psychiatrists, we had to decide to use medication because it was too much. Then she was on blended learning, which ended up being remote for most of the time. Interestingly enough, the blended time was horrible when she was at home because it was asynchronous learning. So the fact that she was not engaged with a teacher and had to work independently using tools, I mean, we had to spy remotely on her computer because, I mean, it\\'s Netflix, it\\'s anime. We\\'re in anime Japanese World 24/7 so much that she would even hide the laptop under her bed so that we forget about it and pull it out at night. We\\'d find her in the closet in the middle of the night watching anime. \\n\\n\\tAnd she said, \"I don\\'t remember. I must have been sleepwalking.\" Those times were hard. I don\\'t know if it\\'s maturity. I mean, it\\'s hard. The remote school thing, I mean, it\\'s constantly needing to juggle between trying to get her to be independent and also have her accept that we\\'re still her parents, and we have to be teachers at the same time. We\\'re in that really weird role of having to do both. Overall, I mean, she\\'s a trooper for most of the time and medication had helped with the crisis and the fact that we put a doorstopper, like one of those remotes so she can\\'t slam the door anymore and break the wall, all of that helped.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nJust to follow up a little bit. It sounds like it started off okay but then it just kind of became really problematic. Was it her actual use of the technology itself that was so problematic or just kind of like secondary effects of use of technology or either her behavior or anxiety or ...\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI think the combination of both. I think the crisis, the pandemic coupled with so much screen time, the need of escapism, I don\\'t know who brought that up earlier that, all of that combined with her anxiety was a wonderful melting pot. I mean, now it\\'s much more under control. I mean, it\\'s not perfect, but at least she doesn\\'t have crisis as many, at all.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, thank you for sharing that. I think we said that, Parent 5, we want to hear from you how was the use of technology for educational purposes once the pandemic started?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nWhen the pandemic started, they went completely virtual. And they tried, they did, they kept the same schedule as when they were in school, as far as hours were concerned. So his day starts at eight o\\'clock in the morning and goes until 3:45 in the afternoon. So typically, he\\'ll go until 4:30. So he was pretty much in that space. They were doing 90-minute blocks. So they broke it down to do 35-minute blocks with a break before they went into the next. His level of focus, I guess it was good, because with his ADHD, he was able to make noise and kind of be in his face, and he was on mute so nobody really heard him. He\\'s [crosstalk 00:32:33] stuff and doing things that keep his mind engaged.\\n\\n\\tIn school, it presents a problem where he would yell out a lot during his class sessions. I\\'m just envisioning, I\\'m like, \"Oh, my gosh. This is what you do in class and why the teachers are always having a fit and calling me and feeling like, \\'What can we do to get him more focused?\\'\" He hasn\\'t been taking his medicine during the pandemic. We\\'ve had some times where it\\'s almost like a threat, like, \"If you don\\'t focus, I\\'m going to make you take your medicine,\" kind of thing. Because the issue in class was he\\'ll be in class all day but he wasn\\'t doing any work. So his teachers would call me or they would text me, and there were like, \"He turned in work but it\\'s all blank.\" In addition to him having to do his night homework, he also now has to do all of the work that he didn\\'t do for class during the day.\\n\\n\\tHe\\'s pretty much on his computer from when he wakes up in the morning at 7:00 until going to bed at night at 9:00 trying to ... With breaks to kind of go to the bathroom and eat. It\\'s a lot. It\\'s overwhelming. A lot of times, just like Parent 1 was just saying, we had to do some stop gaps, too. We got the blink camera to put in the room so that I\\'m able to see or listen or hear. If he\\'s listening or watching a video game or watching YouTube instead of participating in classes, I\\'m like, \"It has to be something more than you telling me that you\\'re in class and you\\'re not doing the work.\" I had him sit in a room and it\\'s difficult because I\\'m working and it\\'s like, \"Okay, I\\'m trying to oversee,\" And like I said, I have three kids so I\\'m trying to [inaudible 00:34:33] all of them in virtual learning. And trying to keep them all up to par in what they\\'re doing. I definitely felt that it was challenging.\\n\\n\\tBut the good parts about it were that he was able to connect with friends and family members that he wouldn\\'t on a regular basis. On the weekends, if he did well in school, I\\'m like, \"Okay, then you can spend time with your family.\" But that just meant more time on the screen. Maybe on a different type of device. Now, it\\'s the TV instead of the computer. Or maybe it\\'s his, what do you call it? His phone or other electronic devices. But it\\'s still, to me, overkill. And I feel like when he goes back to school, I think it\\'s just going to be much harder, because I don\\'t know what the [inaudible 00:35:27] kind of does that look like. With overstimulation and then they go from overstimulation to something not so [crosstalk 00:35:35]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 5, you just segued us into the next topic, which is going to be returning to school. But before we do that, I just want to say hi to [inaudible 00:35:49]. I\\'m assuming that ...\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nHi. That\\'s my son\\'s name. I just didn\\'t know how do it. I\\'m sorry. My name is Parent 6. It\\'s Parent 6.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 6. Welcome. Thank you for joining. Just to catch you up to speed a little bit where just moving through some different discussion questions to share your experience during the pandemic as it relates to technologies. Maybe if you don\\'t mind just sharing the age of your kids and what your experience was with technology for educational purposes before the pandemic. Was it beneficial? Did you have any concerns? And maybe how that changed or if that changed with the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nOkay. I have an 11-year-old boy who is in sixth grade, and I have a seven-year-old girl who is in first grade. Prior to the pandemic, I don\\'t believe that they really use too much of the computer before for schoolwork, because they just had live classes. If they had to research something, my son, but not really, my daughter, too much. And the only time they ever really used gadgets and electronics is for pleasure or after school. But once the pandemic started, he came home with a Chromebook, and this is the end of it for us.\\n\\n\\tMy son is ADHD, he does not take any meds. But I was fully remote with them when it started and was able to sit and watch these classes go on. At first, it didn\\'t seem like much. It seemed like it was actually working with him, to helping him kind of some of the issues he was having in physical form in school he wasn\\'t having so I thought like, \"This is good. It\\'s working for him.\" But that was not true. Like the other woman was saying how they would submit documents or the homework, and it would be submitted and you think it\\'s done, the thing is blank.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYes. It\\'s very similar to what Parent 5 was saying.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI realized that all these assignments, I mean, it was a huge issue because he had 16 assignments that he did not do in his strongest subject, which is even worse. It was dribs and drabs of many things with half of the work. I find that they\\'ve gone through so many changes as far as technology goes. Just being on it all day and then being on it for pleasure. I don\\'t know, for me, I find that although I am handling a kid who is just starting puberty so I know that you get a lot of other things that come with that as far as friction with rules and stuff. We\\'ve argued more than ever, ever before. It is a constant argument about like, \"It\\'s so easy to work. All you have to do is show your face, ask a question, and submit the work.\" \\n\\n\\tThe grades are watered down. I feel like the technology has just they justify the scheduling as though when you look at it like, \"They\\'re going to have two hours of live Zoom.\" But the two hours of live Zoom is just live. It\\'s not the 10 hours or the eight hours that they spend a day on it to do the work, to do the Zoom, to do the rest, and then everything else. It has not been good on this end. For him, especially. For my daughter, not as much of an issue. But for him, yes. \\n\\n\\tAnd just to note, they\\'ve done remote, they\\'ve done in school, which they called kind of a hybrid. But it\\'s still remote. It\\'s still remote in a building. It\\'s not remote in your house, because they\\'re doing it off the computer. It\\'s not like they\\'re having live actual instruction like they used to. They\\'re still with the same overstimulation and everything else that goes along with that. I haven\\'t found anything really positive to say about it at all.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, Parent 6. Let\\'s move into the next question, which is I think some people have returned already or anticipating returning. I\\'d like to hear a little bit about what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end? Whoever wants to go first. Parent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay. Real quick. Both my kids, my son is ADHD and ASD, my daughter is ADHD and learning disabilities. But I had to make the choice because of the sentiments that everyone said, I had to make the choice to put them in Catholic school this year, because I needed him to be in-person at least five days a week. And that was a financial decision that was not taken lightly. I actually found probably one of the cheaper, less expensive Catholic schools to put them in for five days a week. And even then, there was still points where he was fully remote because maybe someone was self-professed positive test for COVID. He actually tested positive for COVID as well so he was fully remote for three weeks, several times since September, we\\'ve been remote. So it\\'s been very difficult.\\n\\n\\tEven in person, it\\'s still very difficult. Because he still has people who are also remote in his classroom so that\\'s also a big thing. That\\'s also another distraction for him in class. So that\\'s a different type of distraction. He\\'s getting in-person but there\\'s other kids who are being remote. So that\\'s another distraction for him, which is another ball of wax. That when it\\'s to distraction, he comes home, like today, he came home and it was obviously a very bad day for him because it was a very bad car ride for me. It was bad. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou can tell by that. Even in-person, you\\'re still seeing challenges as he returns with ... I\\'ve heard a term yesterday in one school, they were calling them Roomies and Zoomies. So the people who are in the room are the roomies and the ...\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nExactly. My daughter, she even goes to a charter school and they were remote three days and in-person two days. Now they are remote one day, in person four days. But she has her own paraprofessional so it\\'s a little bit easier for her but she gets overwhelmed. Her ADHD is more of the impulsive. I think I chalk it up to her being a girl. She\\'s not as much as emotional as he is. He\\'s very emotional. It causes a whole different ball of wax because like I said, if he\\'s had a bad day at school, we are all going to have a very bad day at home.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo even being in-person, it sounds it can be challenging.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWho wants to go next and share just concerns about returning? Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThe return to school, I mean, right now, she\\'s three days one week, two days the other week. That\\'s been really awesome and nice. She\\'s really happy every time she comes home, much more cooperative, it\\'s still difficult to get her out of bed. It\\'s awesome when she\\'s in school for all of us. She keeps saying she miss being home. The concern I have is that where I\\'m hoping we\\'re going to be able to go back five days a week. But the two concerns that I have about really as more and more kids transition to going back fully in school is addressing any form of, for lack of a better word, PTSD. I did bring it up at the school as part of the SLT to what are they going to do for social and emotional well-being of the kids when they go back to school.\\n\\n\\tThe other thing that I would like to see taught in school is form of online ethics. I don\\'t know. The fact that kids trust so much what they see and read online, and it would be great if there was a class about helping them learn about cyber security, being able to recognize on their chat rooms when there\\'s possible grooming, phishing and all of that, and understanding that there\\'s no privacy once you\\'re online. It\\'s not private, it\\'s public. So all of that is something that, especially after seeing what ... They communicate in so many different places online and I can\\'t control all of those chat rooms. There\\'s [inaudible 00:47:18] publicly know that. And I think for their own safety, I think it would be great that ...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. If they\\'re going to give them this tool, then teach them how to use it and how to be safe with it. I like that point a lot. Who wants to go next about returning back, anything you\\'d like to see stay? What would you like to see go? Concerns?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI would say my son\\'s school is not going back this session. They are going to be remote throughout this session, because he goes into charter school. Doing good independently. Unlike before, when he goes to school, he is not writing any notes, he\\'s not doing anything. I get all these phone calls, emails. He has to come back home, I have to start writing, I have to start the homework, helping with most of the homework. Type it or write it in his notebook, because some of his teachers will insist that they want the note and it has to be updated. So I have to just write the note for him. He\\'s back, less work for me now because he works independently, he\\'s able to do his homework on his own on his computer, turns it in at the right time. I don\\'t have to do all this paperwork for him. But my concern is now when he goes back to school, to him, he doesn\\'t want to go. He wants to stay remote. He prefer in remote because he\\'s able to do his work and is able to get ...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry. Your son, he wants to stay remote because what?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHe wants to stay at home because he\\'s able to do his work better and turns his own work faster. It doesn\\'t have to do with all this side things like bullying, maybe harassing and the treatment from all those mates at school. He\\'s in his pace at home, he moves around. Although he gets distracted sometimes. Just YouTube while the class is on, so he gets ... The teacher calls him, he\\'s fumbling on his [inaudible 00:49:40] to respond and all those things.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI have to go back to ... We\\'ll be writing most of the time [inaudible 00:49:47] close to him. And when the teacher [inaudible 00:49:53] the teacher talk, put on the volume so I can hear and know when they him and just direct him and assist him. So going back to school next session is a problem that he doesn\\'t want to think about for now. Because since the pandemic, he refused going anywhere. He doesn\\'t trust anything. He doesn\\'t even trust the vaccine. I told him I took the vaccine, I\\'m okay. He still does not because it was too fast to develop the vaccine. He\\'s autism with ADHD, anxiety from depression, and all of those things with it.\\n\\n\\tMy concern is going back. And as Parent 1 said, internet safety, very, very important. How will the school handle this when they go back? Sometimes he goes on some sites, and he just gets up and starts screaming and running around, \"I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared.\" He can\\'t sleep, he can\\'t do anything because of some things that he saw when he was on that site. I have a nephew in England, his age, too, 13-year. And he is all over the world with people that he doesn\\'t know. He also has autism. There was a time he told his mother he was leaving London to go to Birmingham to meet somebody that he had been communicating with on the internet. How do they recognize the good ones from the bad? How do they recognize who they are really chatting with when they\\'re online? This is a very big issue and a concern to me, actually.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nDoes anyone else want to share thoughts or concerns about returning? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy biggest concern with returning for my child is ... Like I said, I shared a little bit earlier is how he\\'s going to be able to control his body. Again, when he was home, I\\'m not restricting him as far as controlling his body. But at school, they consider it as safety issue because if he\\'s tapping or he\\'s putting his pencil on top of ... I mean, there\\'s plenty of chairs that my son has broken while he\\'s been ... Folding chairs that he\\'s broken because he\\'s lean back on them or things like that. But that\\'s home. School is a different story, that\\'s a big like, \"Oh, my gosh, that\\'s so insane.\" I\\'m really worried about that and how that transition from being ...\\n\\n\\tAnd then he also hasn\\'t been out as much, either, because he\\'s been so bogged down with schoolwork. So I\\'m worried about the overstimulation because even for myself, my youngest starting into school, so I started to drop her off to school and pick her up. Just the fact of me going out for three hours a day, I come back so tired because I feel like I\\'m so overwhelmed with everything that I had to pay attention to and monitor that I didn\\'t have to do for a year. So I\\'m concerned of how that if it\\'s bothering me as an adult, I can only imagine how that\\'s going to reflect on them.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s suggesting back to the that concept of it that way. Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMy child is on the verge of leaving the nest, I suppose, maybe. He has two credits left to go with high school. He\\'s right now in the process of deciding whether or not he wants to go to a community college or going to a trade. I\\'m actually looking forward for him being out of the house and coming into contact with people. Because what I\\'ve been finding with him is that he has been getting along and listening to erroneous news, fake news, basically.\\n\\n\\tSome of this is also just being antagonistic and wanting to be. He just wants to do a reaction. He says something reactionary about everything that\\'s going on from the pandemic itself, from vaccine, Black Matter, Asian sentiments that\\'s been going on. It\\'s just driving me crazy. And he needs to get out into the world instead of being locked up into this little box where he\\'s controlling what information he\\'s getting. That\\'s what I want.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI think it\\'s almost like you get trapped in this alternative world, that\\'s not your life he can get sucked into. So it sounds like for you, you\\'re just looking forward to him returning to normal life as much as possible. Let\\'s now just transition into the last part. So sorry, Parent 6, but were you going to something?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nNo. I was just going to say one of the things that I think really kind of concerns me is that as he\\'s gone back into the building ... My children go to charter school as well. And they\\'ve created so much about wearing a mask, and my son, he\\'s at home, he\\'s not going to wear a mask in our house. So much emphasis on it. Even wearing a mask while they went to recess and his mask fell down a little bit under his nose, and they stopped him from recess and were like, \"No, you have to. Your mask were down.\" I mean, some of the things are getting so kind of, for me, a little ridiculous that it\\'s you\\'re breathing your own CO2 all day, getting headaches, all this stuff. If the kid is going to go outside, then let him breathe the fresh air. They don\\'t have to be next to each other. He can run alone, he doesn\\'t need anybody running with him. He has so much energy. But it\\'s like they\\'re getting so ... There\\'s so much more anxiety build up that it just doesn\\'t help. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, so [crosstalk 00:57:06] those rules and restrictions that are associated with going back and social distancing. Especially if you\\'ve spent all your time at home and you\\'re not used to wearing a mask, it can be hard to adjust in that.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nAnd the thing is when you have a kid like mine, super sensitive, he\\'s very affectionate, he doesn\\'t like ... For him to socialize with the new kids because he went into the school last year. So he didn\\'t even really make friends when March came around. It\\'s like he had no roots. He was in another school for four years. So it\\'s like how do you make friends with people if you don\\'t get close to them? He\\'s a very touchy feely kid. And it\\'s like, \"Now this touchy feely kid was trying to make friends. Now has to be ...\" The expectations, especially when they know your kid has special needs and special attentions and accommodations, that they don\\'t really look at those things fully. And everybody\\'s on someone\\'s scale and it shouldn\\'t be that way. Because I feel like kids with accommodations, those needs have to be met because these kids ... I find my kid is zoning out like things don\\'t matter. And you\\'re talking about a kid who was honorable student. And it\\'s how can this be affecting him in that way? That\\'s all I wanted to say.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m just going to real quick ... I apologize. I\\'m not going to hijack this time. I was just going to say for us parents who have our children in charter. My daughter\\'s charter is 65% IEP so that\\'s a little different. But other charter schools, that\\'s the thing about charters, that\\'s the gamble. They kind of comply with the IEPs, they kind of don\\'t but that\\'s the thing about charters. We got to take it, we don\\'t have to take it. Just depends on the charter. It\\'s such a hard thing. And I know a lot of folks have just mentioned about keeping track of your kid online. \\n\\n\\tI put Bark on child\\'s my laptop. It\\'s B-A-R-K, it\\'s an app that you download. You have to pay for it but at least it tells you if someone\\'s fishing them. If someone\\'s saying the key words and stuff like, that they send an alert to you. So that\\'s B-A-R-K. I put Bark on my kid\\'s laptop so I can get the alerts. At least, that would be like, \"Okay, let me figure this out.\" But it is an awful ... It\\'s such a hard time that we\\'re all going through. Even I as an adult, one of my emails got like I got an alert, alert. It\\'s on the dark web. I\\'m like, \"I don\\'t even know what the hell the dark web is.\" \\n\\n\\tWe\\'re exposing to our kids all of these things. And if your child has ADHD or ASD or ADHD with other comorbidities, it\\'s even more difficult. Because it\\'s like it\\'s so hard to protect them. You want to protect them, you want to do what\\'s best. But at this point in time, you don\\'t even know what\\'s best for your child. Because you know the COVID rate amongst kids is less than 1%. Going back to what she was saying about if your child is a social little person, then what are you going to tell them? Like, \"You can\\'t be that social. You got to stay arms away.\" But that\\'s so difficult for a kid to comprehend that.\\n\\n\\tI\\'s very distressing. I\\'m not going to cry. But it\\'s such a very distressing time that this is a distressing time for us as adults. It\\'s an even more distressing time for our children. I know one mom just mentioned about the kid not being able to sit still. If that\\'s the case, on your kid\\'s IEP, you can get a sensory cushion and have that with your kid just so they can help. My son, for the longest time, I had him to have a sensory cushion. He was getting in trouble. He was sneaking ... In elementary school, he\\'s in junior high school now, but he was sneaking into the classrooms, into the closets to inhale marker. That\\'s not good. Like, \"Oh, no,\" right, exactly. He inhale marker. Well, that is a sign of anxiety. And I said to them, I\\'m like, \"When are you planning on telling me this? After he\\'s graduated from smelling markers to something else? When are you planning on saying, \\'Hey, your kid has anxiety?\\'\"\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, Parent 3. Now, I think you did a really nice ... \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, no, don\\'t apologize. It\\'s important to highlight those points, especially the social part. I want to use another 10 minutes. I really appreciate your time. The last topic I would like to hear from you guys about is just a specific focus on social media. I know a few of you have touched on this a bunch. I\\'d like to hear from you a little bit about any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides. Whoever wants to go first.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI will go first because I have to get off. What social media is starting to ... I mean, he still hasn\\'t really gotten on to it. The kid versions where he\\'s able to connect with his cousins. I\\'ve also found that his relationships with school have not been the greatest because he hasn\\'t been able to see them in person. But because he\\'s able to see his cousin, those relationships have grown more. I\\'m not sure what the correlation is. It\\'s been there. But that\\'s who he\\'s been in this space with. And very early on and a lot of you were talking about some of the challenges with navigating the world wide web with the children.\\n\\n\\tOne of the things that we did, there was a, I forget, I was trying to see if I could find it, but it was a video that kind of talks about kidnappings and things like that that were kind of happening. It was an actual show, and we sat down and we watched it. We had a long conversation afterwards. Like, \"This is why I don\\'t want you having conversations about where you live or letting even ...\" Because he has a younger brother, I\\'m like, \"Even being able to communicate.\" I said, \"Sometimes your brother might say something to give indicators about the community that we live in, that might lead them that much closer to the house.\" So just helping them to be more aware of and be mindful of their surroundings and how the information might be perceived on the other side has been a big point for my husband and I and what we\\'ve been trying to relay to him. Because we want to have him to be more autonomous.\\n\\n\\tI think somebody was sharing the site, I put on a blocker on the phone and on the computer as well so then I\\'m getting alerts where he\\'s going to YouTube and some of these things. Because even videos that are coming up that are way too inappropriate, in my opinion, where they\\'re showing crosses, devils, and all kinds of things. That\\'s not something that I want my 12-year-old to be engaging and experiencing at this time. So the social media platform, I feel like has definitely expanded and is now more so like in the TikTok era, in the YouTube era. I know YouTube has been trying to do a lot to try to curb it but it\\'s still not great. So those are just some of the things that I know that I\\'ve been doing to kind of manage it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, Parent 5.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI just wanted to jump in real quick. So sorry about outside. But in addition to social media use, I know that some kids aren\\'t on social media yet. So even if it\\'s just the YouTube or like watching movies or videos, any sorts of media that your child has been engaged in over the past year, definitely tell us about it. And once again, I\\'m very sorry about outside.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry [inaudible 01:06:12].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSo social media, interestingly enough, I think it\\'s been in a weird way better. I don\\'t know if it\\'s because she\\'s maturing. Also, girls start social media, I think, earlier than boys in general. We had talks, we had contracts beforehand. There\\'s no selfies allowed on Instagram. It\\'s a way of showcasing art, it\\'s not about looking how many likes. And it turns out that they don\\'t really use Instagram the way that they were mostly about posting stories. So they\\'re more in the Snapchat, in and out world of showcasing what they like.\\n\\n\\tI think it\\'s been really fun, because I can see what she\\'s interested in it in things. And they\\'ve been really good conversation starters. Also, it\\'s a great way of monitoring her growth and seeing who she\\'s chatting with. It\\'s been kind of interesting. The only thing that worries me in the social media world is all those. Because I discovered Discord, and then there\\'s chat rooms and games. But there\\'s also, what is that? There\\'s that one game that everyone plays and all the adults love too. I forgot what it\\'s called.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAmong Us?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes. It\\'s been great. Strategy and fun. The only area that I worry the most is YouTube, I must admit, because that\\'s the area where she feels very comfortable commenting on a lot of things, and not realizing that she still comments like a little girl, with mistakes and all that. So that\\'s my only concern, but overall, I find, interestingly enough, a positive experience.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:08:18].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI didn\\'t expect it.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI don\\'t think my experience has been pretty good. I think for my little one ... My son is always on animes and looking at gamers showing videos of games and listening to commentary. I think he watches a lot of puppet show. Things I find very silly and immature. I\\'m like, \"Okay, not a big deal.\" But my little one, she likes to watch all these toy openings and kids talking about things that they\\'re opening and she wants a YouTube channel. But I have found that I had to put some blocks on there because I had a lot of completely sexualized, inappropriate things pop up that I was mortified that she was on it and it was ... \\n\\n\\tAnd her brother noticed it. And I\\'m like, \"What is that?\" She was on just some kind of kitten. It just popped up. And she, of course, you see something you never seen before. You\\'re going to be like ... And it was so instinctual. She was trying to hide. And I was like, \"How can this just come up out of nowhere?\" There was like nothing that she was on before. I feel like the bad guy because I had to completely stop it. Like, \"No, you can\\'t get on it.\" And she said, \"But I just want to see the video of the games and the kids. I want to have my own channel.\"\\n\\n\\tAnd I\\'m just like, \"This kind of stuff. I can\\'t have porn going in front of my seven-year-old. This is highly problematic.\" I find that even when you do it and you do the YouTube for kids, it\\'s not even that safe either because there\\'s some anime styles that are just, for my taste, a little too much at this point in time. I feel like they haven\\'t been able to have so much happening. We couldn\\'t go on vacation because of COVID and everything. When it first happened, we had to cancel. I feel like they\\'ve lost so much that the one thing they have is the internet. And it\\'s now I have to be the bad guy and say, \"No, you can\\'t be on this.\" It\\'s frustrating to say the least.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnyone else, media use before the pandemic, had changed during the pandemic, concerns, benefits? Parent 3? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nGo ahead. I can wait. Parent 2, if you want, go ahead.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSorry. I\\'ll be quick. One of the things that I find is that these kids, their attention spans ... I mean, first of all, the [inaudible 01:11:25] kind of problem with their attention span. And with the internet and everything that\\'s on it moves at the speed of light and so quickly. They\\'re getting information that is stunted in a lot of ways. So they\\'re not even getting full pictures. But my son gets a lot of his news from memes. And they\\'ll come to me and be like, \"Mom, this and so and so.\" I\\'m like, \"Are you freaking kidding me, dude? Why don\\'t you watch PBS News Hour with me and get the full picture? And then you can make up your mind and have ...\" It\\'s just ridiculous. Anyway, that\\'s my piece.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nLet me see. Mine go on these, YouTube videos, watch them. And then Discord, he does Discord so much now. He organizes his own, whatever you call the [inaudible 01:12:19], and when he says something that is obsessing, he comes back and start complaining about it. In the bathroom, you will hear him ranting and complaining and whining and everything continuously. Then I have to stress, \"You know what? You have to stop it. I\\'m going to take you all. I\\'m going to take the computer, I\\'m going to take everything.\" \"I\\'ll stop. I\\'ll stop it.\" Goes back in that circle and all of those things. I don\\'t know how to stop him. I really want to but I don\\'t know how to stop him. But his cousin is engaged, he connect with other people. And this is it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4, can I just ask as a follow up, did you notice that has happened a change since the start of the pandemic or was that always the case that it was a challenge with media?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nBecause of pandemic. He came too engrossed in that [inaudible 01:13:19] before the pandemic.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI just want to say, Parent 4, why are you in my house? Parent 1, why are you in my house? Parent 2, the only thing you\\'re miss ... I\\'m missing out on memes. [crosstalk 01:13:34] because everything you guys just said is my house. The screaming at the computer and just the ridiculous ... I call it bochinche, which is Spanish for gossip. Not even good gossip. Like little lady gossip, \"All the bochinche, all the bochinche.\" \"It\\'s like, \"Stop with the bochinche and the nonsense.\" It\\'s so much worse. Then also the other thing is when your kids are in-person, \"How much can mommy say brush your teeth? And put deodorant on, you smell\"? After a while you\\'re like ...\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\n100%.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBut if it\\'s your peers saying, \"Dude, you freaking stink,\" you\\'re liable to take that more. You\\'re like, \"Man, I was totally embarrassed. I\\'m going to put deodorant and I\\'m going to brush my teeth.\" You know what the mask has done? It\\'s hidden bad hygiene and enabled it to be okay.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s really interesting. They\\'re missing all that normal, typical peer feedback way, which it\\'s ... The natural way to learn these social lessons that they\\'re really missing now. We\\'re actually going to end it here. But I have to say this has been an amazing group. I feel the support and love. It\\'s been really great hearing from you guys and really helpful for us to just learn more in-depth, hear your experiences. [inaudible 01:15:20], I don\\'t know if you want to say anything to close us out.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nJust thank you guys so much for just all the information that you gave us today. Especially all the stuff that\\'s in the chat. You\\'re also the first group that\\'s actually utilized the chat, gave more information to the conversation. So we thank you for every single bit of information that you guys have given us today. And just the camaraderie in the community. We\\'re just finding that a lot of times with the focus groups, we\\'re hearing a lot of the same themes being repeated amongst parents. I hope you guys are just in agreeance that your experiences, even though they have differences, a lot of our parents are going through the same things with their kids. So we thank you for that because it helps us with the research that we\\'re trying to do.\\n\\n\\tThen just the information that we\\'re gathering will also be used for the town hall meeting that we\\'ll be having between either May or June. So we just thank you guys for that. In regards to compensation, you should get it no later than Monday. You might even get it in the next couple of minutes just depending on if our administrator is able to send it out. But if you have any questions or concerns or don\\'t receive it by Monday, please feel free to reach me out. Reach out to me via email or through my number, which is on the bottom of the multiple emails that I\\'ve sent you guys over the past couple of days. So once again, thank you guys so much.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThank you. For me, this was therapy. Meeting you [crosstalk 01:16:47].\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThank you so much.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nIt feels crazy, right? Take good care. God bless everyone. Bye-bye.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, everyone. Take care.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nBye.'b'Parent 1:\\n\\n(silence) \\n\\n\\tHello, good afternoon. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi Parent 2 and Parent 1 Thank you guys for joining. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi. Good afternoon. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nGood afternoon. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo I think we\\'re going to be a group of either five or six parents today so I\\'m just going to wait for a few more people to sign on. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\n\\t(silence) \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 3. Welcome. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi. Sorry. I had the volume all the way down so I couldn\\'t hear but I-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo problem. We\\'re just waiting a few minutes for everyone else to join but we\\'ll hopefully [inaudible 00:07:46] soon. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAs soon as I came into my room, my husband\\'s out there but I can hear my kids start fighting. He was like, \"Why do you start fighting the instant your mother goes into the other room?\" Better him than me, I suppose. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s nice they\\'re doing something else. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nRight. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 6. Welcome. Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Hi, Parent 4. Welcome. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:08:43]. Hi. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, everyone. Hi, Parent 5. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYes, yes. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, welcome. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:08:56]. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo we\\'re all here. So thank you so much for taking out some time to [inaudible 00:09:05]. We know that you all filled out our crisis questionnaire already and we really just want to use this to go a little bit more in depth, to hear about your experiences with technology over the past year and a half since the start of the pandemic. So I was thinking we could start by just going around, say your name, maybe the age of your kids, and if you have a good TV or movie recommendation for something that you\\'ve watched, maybe share that with us as well. So I can start. My name is Moderator 1. I am a neuropsychologist with the Healthy Brain Network. And a good TV show that I have started to get into during the pandemic is Good Girls. It\\'s about three housewives who end up getting involved in crime. I really like it. So it\\'s nice to meet you all. Thank you for taking some time. So who would like to go next? \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI can go. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Hi, Parent 2. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m Parent 2. I live in Brooklyn. I\\'m an academic advisor. I have a 14-year-old son. And a movie that I just saw was Thunderforce, which is cool with two women that are like superheroes. That was funny. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh, cool. Thanks, Parent 2. Who\\'s next? \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi, Parent 5. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHi. My name is Parent 5. I\\'m Andrew\\'s mom. He\\'s 12 years old and we live in Brooklyn as well. We had a chance to go to the theater in February and we saw the new released Tom and Jerry movie and it was amazing. My kids enjoyed it so much. It was funny. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. That sounds fun. Thanks, Parent 5. Who\\'s next? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi. My name is [Parent 1 00:11:15]. Hi. Yes. My name is Parent 1. I have a handsome and inquisitive young 10-year-old son. His name is Kal-El, like Superman. And we\\'re originally from New York and we have been enjoying some quality time during this quarantine, although we have a little bit of cabin fever. I\\'m not too much of a TV watcher, however, I am a book reader and a few of my favorite books thus far is The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles and Opening Your Mind to Prosperity by Catherine Ponder and some of the principles in those books I\\'ve been allowing my son to also study. And it\\'s more so about opening your mind and creating your world through the power of thought. So I definitely recommend those books. And thank you for welcoming me and I\\'m grateful to be a part of this group today. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, Parent 1. Who wants to go next? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'ll go. I\\'m Parent 3 and I have three children, they are 15, almost 11, my middle child will be 11 on Tuesday, and five. My oldest two are enrolled in the study. Anyway, I live in Brooklyn. What was the other thing? Oh, the show or something. It\\'s funny, I haven\\'t watched anything really contemporary, but my husband has been binge watching shows like American Horror Story and I\\'ve been binge watching period romance and dramas and stuff. I\\'m the opposite. During the pandemic I\\'ve just been looking for total escape, so like Jane Austin, different mini series and Outlander and Pole Dark and stuff like that. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI hear that. I hear that, Parent 3. Thank you. Okay. Who\\'s next? Parent 4? Parent 6? \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI guess I\\'ll go. My name is Parent 6. I have three kids, two were enrolled in the study. I have an 11-year-old, I have an eight-year-old, and a four-year-old. They\\'re all boys. I haven\\'t really watched much shows recently, but I do a lot of reading as well. Good book that I really enjoyed recently was The Alchemist is a pretty good book that I\\'ve read recently. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you. Thank you, Parent 6. And Parent 4? You there, Parent 4? I think you\\'re on mute right now. Parent 4, I think you\\'re on mute but try to see if you can get your audio on. In the meantime, [Administrator 00:14:53], do you want to introduce yourself? \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi, everyone. Wait, can you all hear me? Awesome. So I\\'m Administrator. I am a research assistant here at HBN and the person that\\'s been hounding you all. So thank you all so much for being here. Introductions. I forgot what we were doing. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIf you have a TV show, book, movie-\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYes. Okay. So the TV show would be Lovecraft Country. It\\'s based on a book but it\\'s set in I think the Jim Crow era and basically the protagonist, he\\'s a Pitts family bloodline as a part of magician cult thingy. So he\\'s trying to garner the magic to share to his offspring. And it\\'s an adventure and all that good stuff. It\\'s really, really good. They finished season one and I\\'m looking forward to season two. It\\'s on HBO Max. I don\\'t know about any other things. Oh, I\\'m from Brooklyn. Yeah. That\\'s my introduction. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, Administrator. Okay. So Parent 4, if we can help you, you can use the chat and just let us know if there\\'s anything we can help you with. Yeah, definitely pipe up whenever you\\'re audio starts working. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. Can you hear me okay? \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. We can hear you. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:16:29]. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYes. Hi, Parent 4. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. I don\\'t know. I didn\\'t quite hear what part of the introduction. What would you like from us to present in this introduction. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nJust say hi, the ages of your kids, and if you have a recommendation for us for TV, book, movie. We\\'d love to hear. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOh. I just got to second that Lovecraft one because I totally, totally enjoyed that. My kids, I have four children, two older and two younger. So I would say I have two sets of kids. So my first two, my son is a principal and my daughter is a district manager for a business. And the last two, my daughter is in the third grade, so she\\'s 12 ... No. Wait a minute. And I have a 12-year-old and an eight-year-old. I\\'m the mom, right? And I have a 12-year-old and an eight-year-old. Those are the last two. And the last two are girls. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nVery nice. Okay. Thank you, Parent 4. Okay. So again, thank you all for coming. I was thinking that we could start with a little exercise. If you have a paper and pencil nearby, try to jot down a few positive ways that technology has impacted your children during the pandemic and als then a few negative ways that technology has impacted your children during the pandemic. So let\\'s just take a few minutes to do that and then we\\'ll discuss. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI have to go get a pen and paper for that. [crosstalk 00:18:22]. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 3. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHello? Can you hear me okay? \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYes. We can hear you, Parent 4. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. I\\'m trying to move where I can get a great wifi signal because I see that\\'s what the problem is. I can get mine too, because I don\\'t have a pen and paper right now. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So I\\'ll ask for them in a minute. But, yeah. When we discuss, just think about them if you don\\'t have a pen and paper. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnd then as you\\'re jotting them down, I\\'d also like you to think between the positives and the negatives, which one has had the biggest overall effect? So has the negative parts of technology had a bigger overall impact on your children or have the positive effects had a bigger overall impact? And just circle whichever one.\\n\\n\\t(silence) \\n\\n\\tOkay. Does everyone have some things jotted down or in their mind? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So by show of hands or speaking up if you\\'re not on video, how many people circled the negative list as having the bigger overall impact. Okay. Parent 6 circled the negative list, Parent 2, Parent 5. I see Parent 4. Okay. Parent 1, did you circle the negative or the positive list? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI circled the positive. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. And what about you, Parent 3? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'m really finding it hard to choose. I still think it\\'s a tossup. And partly too, with the two kids, there are different benefits and challenges for each one. I\\'m falling right in the middle. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah. Let\\'s definitely go into that. I think it sounds like there are negatives and positives all around. I definitely encourage ... As we go through this discussion, what we\\'ve been seeing is that there are a lot of people who are having very overlapping experiences and agree on some things and then there are definitely people who hare having different and more unique experiences. So please feel free to chime in on your individual experience even if it may be different than what you\\'re hearing from other people. So the first question that I want to put out there for discussion is how did your children use technology for educational purposes before the pandemic? And did you have any concerns or what were the benefits of technology for education before the pandemic? And then maybe speak a little bit about now during the pandemic, how that has changed, if that\\'s changed, and if you have more concerns or if it\\'s been beneficial during the pandemic? So who wants to start? \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI\\'ll start. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI can go first. [crosstalk 00:22:40]. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHere, how about Parent 6. \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSo before the pandemic I feel like, especially with technology, my kids didn\\'t really have much at all that they had to do. My oldest is in sixth grade now, so I think that might have changed going to middle school, however, while they were in elementary school, they really didn\\'t have any assignments that they needed technology for, for the most part. So it was rare. And then, of course, last March school went completely virtual and everything was online. So it was like a night and day change for us. It was a disaster, to be honest. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So what were some of your concerns or what did you find problematic about using technology for education? \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nWell, really, they\\'re on all day. They\\'re on all day. Now, one of my children is a really unique learner and one of them did okay. One of them was able to go on. But then one of them is really ... He\\'s unique and his teacher not seeing him in person, it affected him. Even this year, for example, he started fully virtual at the beginning of the school year and his teacher, since she hadn\\'t met him and she hadn\\'t seen him in person, she didn\\'t grasp that if he wasn\\'t doing an assignment, it wasn\\'t because ... He has ADHD and if he wasn\\'t doing the assignment, it wasn\\'t that he was trying not to do it, he was just having a hard time and she wasn\\'t there to be able to intercept and to sit with him and to see how she could help him. She wasn\\'t able to help him because she didn\\'t know what the problem was because he wasn\\'t there. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. So it sounds like he lost out on that one to one. \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah. Now he\\'s back full time and he is doing a lot better. Still, I feel like they\\'re just online all day long and it\\'s a problem. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you, Parent 6. Can someone else share their experience with technology [crosstalk 00:24:57]. Yes, Parent 1? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI might echo Parent 6 because, similarly, my son too, prior to the pandemic the most time he would spend on any electronic device was either in school for a computer media class and then after school or after homework, he\\'ll have some free time, we call it free time, where he can play on his iPad or his cellphone for a couple of hours before bed. But, I mean, it was a total 180 where now he\\'s fully remote. And actually, it was like a double whammy because I was actually diagnosed with breast cancer in February, so having this diagnosis and having the pandemic and then all of this pressure on my son to make sure that I\\'m healthy, make sure that he\\'s doing well in school, it did take a negative toll at first. \\n\\n\\tBut, again, through reading affirmative things and helping him along and making sure that he sees me in a not just a healthy state but also in a physically healthy situation, it helped him. But literally, his electronic usage went from pretty much nonexistent to almost 200%, because after school he goes directly to his iPad to play. When that dies, he goes directly to his iPhone and then if that dies, then he\\'ll go to my computer to do classwork. It was like a never ending cycle and I have to break him off of it. I would try to have not just physical exercise but mental exercise as well when he\\'s on break and when I also work remotely, fully remote, we would for lunch just go outside, take a walk, just talk about the sky or talk about the birds chirping. Something that we don\\'t have to focus on where it\\'s a problem or it\\'s worrisome. That seemed to help for the time being. But I think when we come back indoors, it\\'s back to the gadgets. \\n\\n\\tI would say his learning, his academics actually improved. He has an IEP. He has-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. I\\'d like to hear about that, because I know that you had said that there was an overall positive effect. So can you speak a little-\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes, yes. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n... on the academic piece. Yeah. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nRight. I mean, as much as he\\'s on these devices, he actually improved academically because it enhanced some of his skills that he already had, his computer skills and navigating. He was able to work independently and actually become a leader in his class where he\\'s in the chatroom trying to troubleshoot those who are even having technical difficulties logging on. It\\'d be so funny. But-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:27:58] tech support for the ...\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nRight. Well, can you help mommy record this Zoom? But I\\'ve seen and his teachers have also seen a very much more confident student and person overall. Not to take up too much time, but my son, he had confidence issues and wanting to be liked by everyone, wanting to be friends with everyone. But this past year especially, he really stepped up to the plate and actually became the leader confidently and was able to excel. So I\\'m very proud of him. I\\'m very proud of him. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. So it sounds like the emphasis on computers skills really brought out some nice strengths for him in those places. Well, good. That\\'s great. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd I\\'m cancer free too. So [inaudible 00:28:49]. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWow. That is really great to hear. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes. Thank you. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI just want to say-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWho wants to go next talking about-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nCan you hear me okay? \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n... technology for education? Sorry, Parent 4? \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nCan you hear me okay because I\\'m struggling with my technology. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. We can hear you. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI can either do video or audio but-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:29:12]-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nEverything at one time is not working for me. So that\\'s why I wanted to go ahead and say what I have to say. So if you can hear me-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYou can hear me? \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWe can hear you. We can hear you. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOkay, great. So it has had a negative impact on my household because it\\'s too much computer time. And I remember those questions when I was filling out one of those questionnaires when I brought my daughter there to be evaluated. It was speaking about the problems in reference to the computers. I\\'m like, \"I don\\'t have those kind of problems. What are they talking about?\" Now fast forward to this pandemic, now I understand. I\\'m having those problems. I\\'m having problems because now she wants to be on the computer all the time and it\\'s hard for me to take it away because she has to do her schoolwork and she\\'s learning remotely. \\n\\n\\tIt\\'s hard to sanction that because she\\'ll say, \"Oh, I need to do my homework, or I need this app or that app.\" It\\'s just difficult to sanction the time so I have to let her use her computer but I catch her and she\\'s getting in trouble with the computer because now all of these open sites and bringing up conversations that I never thought I would have to have with my 11-year-old daughter because she\\'s on all of these different sites. And here, I\\'m putting in all these parental controls but she\\'s very savvy so she can overstep those controls and now her and her friend and then teaching her how not to turn over your screen to your friend, I know you think is your friend, but there\\'s so many things that you can get into problems with. \\n\\n\\tSo for me, I\\'m just devastated by all of this computer time. And I have two children, so even the little one ... I mean, they need some in person. They need to not always have to rely on the computer. And that was my problem even before the pandemic because I saw the teachers were moving into having your children learn more with these apps. And sometimes I have to tell them it\\'s okay for them to use pencil and paper because I feel you learn better, at least until you have the concept, then you can do it on the computer. Yeah. I\\'m not impressed with all of this, everything on the computer. For me, it\\'s just a negative impact. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. And it sounds like it was a big switch for your family and that it also, that point that you made, I appreciate that, that the fact that it\\'s needed for school purposes makes it a little bit harder to control it because it\\'s not like you can just say no computers at all. Okay. Thanks, Joanna. So who-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'ll go. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n... would like to share on that? Parent 3, yeah? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah. So before the pandemic, my oldest daughter who was then in eighth grade, she was the primary computer user in terms of schoolwork. But even then, she still had other things that she could use. She had texts that they would send home. She had articles that were printed out already or worksheets or things like that. She has some trouble with writing. She had OT to help her with writing for, I think it\\'s dysgraphia. And it\\'s much, much better now. So the computer, she tended to use it a bit for anything that involved writing and she did a lot of voice to text and things like that anyway, but she did have a lot of alternatives. \\n\\n\\tMy middle daughter who is about to turn 11, she hardly used the computer at all. She used it sometimes for some research things if she was working on a project. But most of her work was either done in school or it was done on paper. It was read a book and write a paragraph or something like that. She was then in fourth grade. Then, of course, this hit and they were 100% learning online. \\n\\n\\tIt was more successful for my fourth grader because her teacher had it organized. She would give them a checklist on Google Classroom so they could see what they needed to do each day. She would give them a preparation for what was coming up, like, \"Here\\'s what the week will look like.\" And she also had live class sessions and she had it broken into ... She did three meetings per day, and one was a morning meeting to talk about the plan for the day, then she would give them an assignment, then she would have them meet back again an hour later to check in about the assignment and do the next thing. And then in the afternoon she did some small group work. \\n\\n\\tWhere it was really challenging is that my daughter is in a French dual language program and so, of course, and we\\'re anglophone, so that just dropped. I mean, that\\'s one reason why her teacher tried to do a lot of small group work to try to help build that up, but that was certainly a challenge for us. We had to try to find ways to help her be exposed to the language so she wouldn\\'t lose her ability then for starting fifth grade and then struggling. \\n\\n\\tBut my eighth grader, some of her teachers were amazing with checking in and having office hours and doing some instruction and tutoring and things like that online and some of them, it was like they just were phoning it in at the end of the semester and she was teaching herself. And that was very difficult. This year, it\\'s changed because now she\\'s in high school and she\\'s at a performing arts school. It\\'s been a real challenge because her art is violin and it\\'s really hard to do instrumental work with groups Zoom. They\\'ve done their violin lessons on Zoom but it was just one on one. But her orchestra class, they really haven\\'t done any orchestra all year because you can\\'t really do an orchestra on Zoom. There\\'s a lag between the things. So that\\'s been a little bit of a challenge. \\n\\n\\tBut she\\'s had all live classes online this year, because their school, that\\'s how they set it up. That has been fantastic. Because it\\'s enabled two things to happen. One is that because she does have ADHD and she has a really hard time organizing herself, she doesn\\'t really have to organize herself because she\\'s in the lessons all day. And then she has a little bit of homework to do, but it\\'s not an extreme amount. And they do a lot of breakout rooms and stuff so she\\'s able to do some small group work and it helps her, I think, because she doesn\\'t have to be teaching herself. \\n\\n\\tIt also helps because when I\\'m home, I\\'m hearing what she\\'s learning in class. That\\'s been really great. With all my kids, hearing their teachers teaching them online, I\\'ve been blown away by the skill of these teachers. They\\'re amazing. And the thoughtfulness that they put into their projects and developing their curriculum, it\\'s just outstanding and I feel like that\\'s been a great gift to have that insight. And it\\'s also helped me when it comes time for me to help them, because I can say, \"Oh, no. Remember, Mme Simone was saying that you needed to do this with this project. Yeah. I understand you forgot that, but I heard her say it so let\\'s do that.\" So that\\'s been helpful. It\\'s been good. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s actually a very interesting pro, having that little bit up close view [crosstalk 00:37:48], and it sounds like there\\'s been some helpful parts to address ADHD and organization as well. But I\\'m hearing some variability in the quality of education. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah. The challenge that we\\'ve had with mostly my middle daughter is that she also has anxiety and OCD and so she, first of all, can go down a rabbit hole when she\\'s just learning online. Secondly, this year she\\'s been doing blended learning so when she\\'s in school, she\\'s doing all right. When she\\'s at home, she gets almost no work done. I mean, she\\'s been working today and as of the time I came in here, I think she had done one math problem. She just has a really hard time. And I have to see her screen at all times. If I can\\'t see her screen, she\\'s not doing what she\\'s supposed to do and that\\'s [crosstalk 00:38:49]-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo she\\'s having more of a problem doing it independently? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd that makes problems because then I have a five-year-old, and if I have to look at the screen all day of her older sister, I can\\'t be doing things with the five-year-old. And my five-year-old then spends a lot of time coloring or playing with magnet tiles or watching videos because I have to keep saying, \"I\\'m sorry it\\'s a beautiful day. We can\\'t go outside. I have to make sure your sister\\'s doing her work.\" \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. There\\'s only so much resources to support you. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, exactly. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Parent 5, can you share? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah. Well, prior to the pandemic my kids were very exposed to technology. They were using it as well for school. They had a lot of apps for reading. My older son, Andrew, he has a-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWhat were your feelings about it before? Did you find technology to be helpful before the pandemic? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nIt was. It was because it was controlled. Whenever I needed to, I was able to put away the devices. But after the pandemic, like another mommy said, I have a problem taking the laptop away because he uses it for school. Now, the negative of it is my older son who has an IEP is becoming more addicted to the screen. If it\\'s not the laptop, it\\'s the iPad, when the iPad goes empty, it goes to my phone. He\\'s just switching from one device to the other. But as far as school goes, he is doing amazing, a lot better than when he was in school. Remote has done wonders for us. He\\'s more focused. He\\'s totally in charge of his school day. I don\\'t get involved. He gets great grades. And it helped us also with the transition. \\n\\n\\tI was very nervous about Andrew going into sixth grade. It\\'s a new school, new teachers, new system. But that worked out so well for us because now he got to know all his teachers and he\\'s doing great academically. He\\'s doing amazingly. So that was very good. It\\'s just that he\\'s becoming more addicted and less socially involved and that\\'s the part I\\'m not happy with. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. So I\\'m curious to hear a little more. What do you think about the way he\\'s learning now has been so good for him? What about it? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah. Lucky for us, honest to God, I pray for these teachers. They\\'re amazing. I don\\'t know if it\\'s us, we jut are lucky with the teachers he has. They\\'re very dedicated. He has live classes. I don\\'t feel like he\\'s missing anything. And I also get to see how Andrew is like with his teachers and his classmates. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nLike what Parent 3 was saying. Yeah, yeah. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd he takes charge also, like another mommy said. It was funny, I was laughing because he does the same thing. He gives everybody advice on technology. He\\'s like the tech person in the class. Even his teachers, they tell me if Andrew\\'s not there, we get nervous. He\\'s enjoying it. I\\'m happy to see how he\\'s like and he\\'s doing great. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd I feel like when this is all over, when school is over, I can go back to controlling device time, screen time. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. So it definitely sounds like it\\'s been concerning, the addictive part of it, but you\\'re confident that once they\\'re more back in person that you can take over that part again. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHe\\'s not going to give it up willingly. I\\'ll have to hide devices like I used to before, which is fine. It used to work. So it\\'s good. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWe\\'ve had to do that too. We have to lock them in a room. Would it be all right if I just add something to what you ...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, yeah. Add something and then afterwards I\\'m going to move us to the next question. But, yeah. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay. So there were two things that Parent 5 said that reminded me of stuff with my kids. One of them was that the addiction to the screen time is followed by this ... In the beginning of the pandemic at least, we really had to force them to go outside. One of my kids just had a meltdown yesterday because we had to go to in person violin lesson because her teacher resumed that. She says, \"I don\\'t want to go outside. I don\\'t want to go outside.\" So definitely there\\'s been an element of ... Once they\\'re out, it\\'s okay but it\\'s like leaving the apartment has become a bigger deal. And one of my kids, she had almost lost complete contact with friends until she consciously ... We both, we planned it out. You\\'ve got to start contacting your friends because it just slipped away. \\n\\n\\tThe other thing I wanted to say, which Parent 5 was talking about her son\\'s skills with the technology and it\\'s not just the Zoom or the Google Classroom or Google Meet, but my kids have used so many more different types of programs like Flip Grid. They\\'re creating presentations with Google Slides. They\\'re using special effects in their presentations. They\\'re creating videos. The one with the violin, she\\'s working with something called Click Track so that she can coordinate her timing with the timing of someone else\\'s playing so that they can line up their performance videos. They\\'re doing animations for projects. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt [crosstalk 00:44:23] into all these new ways to be really creative. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThat\\'s been amazing to see that, because they\\'ve then been able to use what appeals to them and what works with their skillset and their abilities to do their assignments, because there\\'s a lot of variability in how they present the information and then they\\'ve got this array of options through technology to work with and that\\'s been a real gift as well. So it\\'s definitely been a double edged issue. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. All right. So the next question that I want to put out there is now that either some people have gone back in person or you\\'re anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? So who wants to take that one first? Parent 2? \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'ll go. I guess I\\'m anticipating ... I would like him to go back to school. He\\'s in ninth grade right now. So hopefully he\\'ll be able to go back in person. He does have asthma so that\\'s what I\\'m really concerned about, just him being in person. But I like the aspect that they can utilize their computers in the classroom. That\\'s a good benefit. But I do like the teachers teaching live. That\\'s another thing. But he needs that social skills. That interaction is what really ... It\\'s just me and him in the house and I think we\\'re both getting tired of each other talking to each other. He needs that input with other people, other teenagers his own age. \\n\\n\\tAnd I like that the teachers are incorporating all this new technology. He\\'s learned how to type and just things he should have known how to do, and even learned life skills within the house, which is great. Just so we could incorporate all those things when they go back into the classroom. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Keep the good but it sounds like there are parts of going back that you think are really important like the social part. Okay. Anyone else for-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. This is Parent 4. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 4. Yeah? \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. I will be very excited when they go back in person. The part that the teachers are doing a fantastic job and I have to say they are going above and beyond during this remote learning. And I know one thing they said, \"Oh, my kid is so great. She\\'s so great. She\\'s doing so well. She\\'s leading the class.\" Yeah. She is doing a lot of that stuff because she\\'s home with me every day and the teachers don\\'t really have to deal so much with those behavioral issues because now all the behavioral issues are home with me so she can shine with them for the most part. But for my youngest one, she loves that in person and she needs that. For me, I\\'m working every day from home so to work every day from home and try to teach a third grader and a sixth grader, it\\'s very difficult. So I definitely would love for them to be back in school and in person learning and they can use some of this technology and hopefully the teachers will continue to be as great as they\\'ve always been. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 4. Anyone else for challenges you anticipate in going back? Things you\\'d want to keep, change? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI ...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 1. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi. I\\'m looking forward to ... My daughter\\'s about to start five days. She\\'s been going three days, she\\'s been going two or three days, my five and 11-year-old. It\\'s been so exhausting. Well, it\\'s enabled me to see where the problems and challenges are. I\\'ve asked for an IEP review because I\\'m like, \"These are some other issues that I didn\\'t realize were going on.\" It\\'s been so exhausting and I haven\\'t been able to do any of my work. As I think Parent 4 eluded to or said, it\\'s a struggle to do anything you have to do when you\\'ve got these kids that you have to teach as well. So I\\'m looking forward to them being able to go into the classroom and do and have their learning more focused there. \\n\\n\\tAnd for my five-year-old, it\\'s so important because of the social stuff and for my 15-year-old, she\\'s just going to be starting back three days. And she\\'s done really well with being fairly connected to people given that she\\'s never stepped foot in her school. She\\'s in ninth grade. But it\\'s going to be great for her to be able to be there and really to connect with her teachers and with her classmates. What I\\'m worried about is that ... Well, two things. One, is it gets harder for the older one who needs a little bit more ... Who\\'s not as self directed and so she\\'s then more independent, which actually makes it a challenge for me to keep track of what\\'s going on. \\n\\n\\tBut my 11-year-old has so much anxiety, she gets so many physical symptoms of that, that she\\'s had a lot of school refusal in the past. And having it be just two or three days was what kept us going this year, was you can go, you can have that time, but guess what? When she was refusing on a Wednesday, \"I\\'m not going to school. I feel sick. My stomach hurts. My head hurts.\" We would say, \"But it\\'s the last day of the week. Then tomorrow and Friday you\\'re home.\" So that was what kept us going. I\\'m not looking forward to those morning challenges again because I feel like it\\'s going to be a lot for her because she\\'s just so anxious. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. Especially after being out for so long probably. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAnyone else for challenges going back. Parent 5, yeah? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nWell, my kids are not too excited about going back to school and that worries me. Neither am I. I\\'ve gotten really very selfish. I enjoy having them home. I love having them home. And the only thing we miss really is the social aspect of being physically in school and the after school programs. I had them registered in chess, soccer, all these activities. But having them home has been awesome. So I think it\\'s going to be difficult for all of us when they start going back to school. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. That separation again. You get used to [crosstalk 00:51:16] keeping them close. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI could just briefly-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:51:20]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah. If I could just briefly piggyback off of what everyone had shared is my son has been fully remote and I think with him graduating fifth grade, entering a new school sixth grade. That\\'s already some pressure right there and whether or not he\\'ll be in blended learning or in in-person learning full time, that\\'s really dependent on the current environment around September. My son as well has asthma so, of course, that\\'s always his health. His safety is always at the forefront. And my son, again, I had JD as an IEP so he\\'s very hands on, visual type of student who requires that physical in person learning. It\\'s not to say that he can do without, but in a physical classroom setting I feel that now that he\\'s matured and has a little more confidence, he can enhance those skills better in in-person learning. \\n\\n\\tAgain, I\\'m with Parent 5. We all have enjoyed being ... I\\'m a social butterfly, but I really am recluse as well. And I passed that along to my son. We\\'ve been home together during this time, however, it\\'s going to be a change for the both of us. Myself, I\\'m being called back into work as well. So getting into a new normal, of course, it\\'s going to take some adjusting to, but I\\'m sure that we can overcome any challenges that we face, especially if we are not only physically prepared but mentally prepared for it as well. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, yeah. \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI just want to add my kids have been full time for a while. My husband and I are both essential workers so we\\'ve had no choice other than we had to keep him out of school. They\\'re really happy back in school full time now. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGood. Was it hard for them to go back? Did they face any challenges? \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nMy oldest is now in middle school so he had to wake up early. So he had to get on the bus-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s a challenge regardless probably. \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nHe had to leave at 7:00, so that\\'s really his only complaint. Other than that, he said that he\\'s really, really happy to be back in school. They\\'re really enjoying being with the other kids. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGood to hear. Thank you, Parent 6. So we have about 15 minutes left. I want to be respectful of your time because I really appreciate you taking out some time to talk to us. For the last 10 or 15 minutes, I\\'d like to just shift the conversation a little bit to talking about social media and media use specifically. Just hearing some experiences about what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they\\'re consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you\\'re seeing from changes in social media use? So whoever wants to start us off. \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI\\'ll start us off. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, [crosstalk 00:54:49]. \\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSo what\\'s changed with the social media, so my kids, as I\\'m sure all the rest of the year kids do also, they really like Roblox and they want to play with their friends. So before it was more controlling, okay, you have this amount of time to go on YouTube, you have this amount of time to play. But now, when everybody was home, the Roblox playing with friends and talking on the phone at the same time was the only socialization that they had. That was their only option. So it got a little more and a little more and then they said, \"Oh, well, I\\'m playing with my friends so can I keep playing?\" So then that time extended a little bit. So it\\'s hard when that is the only way that they could socialize or when they\\'re on FaceTime, when they\\'re going on FaceTime with friends. When that\\'s the only way that they could socialize, that has been really difficult to reign it in and stop them from it. So we\\'ve been having a lot of challenges with that. \\n\\n\\tAnd then the YouTube videos start and that\\'s when everything they have, like their school issued iPads, and so I could take away their own personal devices, but the school iPads have YouTube on them. So I can\\'t ... It\\'s for school so I can\\'t just take it away. So then-\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:56:16]-\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\n... they end up sneaking. Mm-hmm (affirmative). It\\'s a lot harder. And sometimes I don\\'t even want to because that\\'s the way that they\\'re able to socialize. They\\'re starting to go to the park with kids and doing more now but it\\'s been a challenge this whole time. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 6. Who wants to go next? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'ll go. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks, Parent 3. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSo I\\'ve had a very similar experience. My then eighth grader was already on social media because I reluctantly let her have an Instagram account because her class at school, her cohort, had a cohort Instagram chat going and they mostly used it for things like, \"Hey, I have a doctor\\'s appointment today. Can anyone tell me what I\\'m going to miss in this class?\" For that type of thing. So they mostly used it well. There were some incidents though of kids sharing porn and things like that on it. That was obviously a problem. But this year, yeah, she\\'s used it really ... That, and the other thing was SnapChat that I was like, \"You cannot have SnapChat. Absolutely not. It\\'s like a sexual predator\\'s playground.\" \\n\\n\\tAnd then she had a friend, a pen pal in New Zealand, who she found out was on SnapChat. So then it was like, \"All right.\" Kind of like Parent 6 was saying, that\\'s how they connect. I mean, yes, they can write letters but it\\'s so much more immediate and they socialize so much more so I was like, \"Fine, okay. You can use SnapChat.\" So it was creeping up. But I think I have to have my rules. I have to have the passwords. I have to have access because I want to make sure that they\\'re safe online. And so I periodically go in and check. \\n\\n\\tMy 11-year-old doesn\\'t have any of these accounts. What she has is YouTube and she\\'s become obsessed with various YouTubers and it\\'s prompted some discussions about what we value and what we don\\'t. She definitely sneaks it when she\\'s not supposed to. That\\'s definitely been a challenge. And again, same thing, school computer, you can\\'t exactly ... I mean, she does have to do work. It\\'s been great in some respects because she\\'s been able to use it for school, but also I don\\'t really want you looking at these people and following what they\\'re doing because I don\\'t agree with it. \\n\\n\\tSo, yeah. That\\'s been a little bit of an issue. I\\'ve worried a lot about body image and things like that with them because I feel like when they\\'re following these people on whether Instagram or YouTube or wherever else, a lot of these people are making tons of money as so called influencers and they have a very different lifestyle. And I feel like sometimes that\\'s hard for them to see. But one of my kids went through a little bit of an issue around food and she was talking about like she wished she could be anorexic because she wanted to be a certain way and we had to have a whole discussion with the psychiatrist around that and talking about positive body image and stuff. And I think she seems like she\\'s on a better path. \\n\\n\\tBut I wanted to say one last thing about it, is that where it has been really good is that my oldest daughter, during this time, she seems to be like a lot of adolescent girls are, I\\'m reading, she\\'s developed vocal and motor ticks, which is one thing I\\'m worried about when she goes back to school. At home she can hide it from people to some degree but when she\\'s in person, it\\'s a lot harder. But she\\'s actually connected a lot with people on Instagram who also have some of these struggles and she\\'s starting to talk about herself more as neurodivergent as opposed to having a disorder and things like that, and learning techniques for managing it. She\\'ll say, \"Oh, I found out that so and so on Instagram has the same kind of ticks that I do and this is what she does to help herself. That\\'s been fantastic, that it\\'s really enabled her to develop a sense of agency around herself and her managing [crosstalk 01:01:17].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Just connect with people that she may not have ever had access to. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, yeah. So that\\'s been the positive, whereas the rest is like a minefield. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, yeah. Thanks for sharing that. Yeah, Parent 4? \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI have to say that my kids, even the eight-year-old, everyone wants to be a YouTuber. They want to be a YouTube star or they want to be famous or Instagram famous and that\\'s killing me right now. Because with everything that\\'s going on, you\\'re like, \"What happened to I wanted to be a doctor or lawyer or teacher?\" Everyone want to be a YouTuber and even the eight-year-old. I\\'ll go, \"What do you want to do on YouTube?\" And she\\'s struggling with, \"Maybe I can open toys.\" I\\'m just so over it. I just feel like I have to get back to basics. And it\\'s harder with the 12-year-old because she\\'s exposed to so much and she\\'s faster than I am with these computer skills. So if I see something I don\\'t like, she can hit two or three buttons and it\\'s done. So I spend the rest of my time going, \"Go back to that page. Go back to that page. I know I saw it.\" \\n\\n\\tI just feel like this whole social media, these influencer ... And I didn\\'t even know what an influencer was before the pandemic. I had to learn all of this during the pandemic. And when they see these kids in these beautiful houses and their parents. The YouTubers where the twin girls or whoever, all I can do is watch it and say, \"Hey, their house is clean. You see they cleaned their room. Are you cleaning your room? They make their beds every day. Yes.\" So these people are making tons and tons of money and they have all of these toys and these beautiful houses. Like one young lady said, the body imaging. I\\'m watching my 12-year-old constantly looking at her body and excited about it or say, \"Hey, I want my boobs bigger or maybe my butt should be bigger.\" I\\'m so over it. \\n\\n\\tSo even when this pandemic is over and these kids are back in school, this whole social media presence is here to stay. And I have to now navigate it so that I know what my kids are doing. And that whole SnapChat, I had to shut SnapChat down so quick because it\\'s just too much. And the schools don\\'t have SnapChat on their computers so I can say, \"Hey, no. We\\'re not having it.\" But the social media presence, I just have to stay on top of it. And with all that I have to do, I really don\\'t want to be on social media like that but I have to. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. It sounds like it\\'s hard to keep up with, but thank you for highlighting [inaudible 01:04:34]. Those are really important points. We have a couple more minutes. Does anyone have anything to add in terms of social media that we haven\\'t already said. Yeah. Hi, Parent 5. Yeah? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI actually thank you for this meeting because I thought I was the only one in this world that\\'s having a problem with YouTubers. My son has developed such an addiction to video game YouTubers and I freak out. I just flip. The more I tell him not to be on them, the more addicted he gets. Like I said, after school I\\'m hiding all devices. Hopefully it\\'ll be under control. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, no. It\\'s a challenge and I think as we\\'re having these meetings, we\\'re hearing that a lot from parents. We really thank you for taking some time to share this and contributing to the research. Part of our goal in this project is to really raise awareness of a lot of the challenges that parents are facing. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAdministrator, do you want to close us out? \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah. Just like Moderator 1 said, we\\'re seeing the same commonalities with the Roblox, the Instagram, YouTube, SnapChat. In fact, all of the parents have been echoing the same thing that you guys have been saying, so you are not alone in your sentiment. And we just really thank and appreciate you for taking the time out to really help us and giving us just your sentiments and the things that you guys have been going through. Just because sometimes, like in yesterday\\'s group, parents were talking about just how some parents will say that they\\'re doing such an amazing job with their kids and everything. And as a parent, feeling as if you\\'re not doing the best, that you\\'re having a hard time just navigating this new life with your child. So we really appreciate all of your sentiments. Thank you so much for just taking the time out to be here with us today. \\n\\n\\tIn regards to compensation, I\\'m going to be sending our administrator your contact information so you guys should be receiving compensation either by today or no later than Monday. So I would say if by Monday evening you don\\'t get it, please do not hesitate to give me a call or email me back just to let me know that you guys did receive it. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThank you very much for the meeting. It was very beneficial for me personally and it was nice meeting all the other parents. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you all. It was a pleasure meeting you. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nDefinitely.'b'Administrator:\\n\\n(silence).\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi everyone. I\\'m, Administrator. We\\'re just waiting for our clinician and our project manager to join the call. Very quickly, this is just for those who didn\\'t get the chance to do it. I\\'m going to be sending the link to the focus group, the Zoom conversation. We\\'ll just need you guys to fill that out and then we will get...\\n\\n\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIs this the consent?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYes, so if you weren\\'t able to complete the consent form, just fill it out right now.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n(silence).\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHi, sorry about that. Oh, I can\\'t hear anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHello.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHey, how are you?\\n\\n\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nGood, how are you?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI\\'m good, thank you. Hi, I\\'m Moderator 2. I\\'m the project director for Healthy Brain Network. How is everyone doing today?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nGood, thanks, Moderator 2.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nGreat. We can get started. I think everyone is here, Administrator, correct?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. You were selected to be part of a focus group, as I\\'m sure you saw the email. We\\'re looking at people who had responded to the crisis survey and where... technology use during the pandemic. But I wanted to get us started. We can go around the room and share our names. And I don\\'t know, the best TV show you have binged lately.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI can start. Hi, everyone, my name is [Parent 2 00:10:10] and I just finished binging The Good Place.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOh, that was a great show.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI can go next. My name is [Parent 3 00:10:25] and the most recent, I don\\'t know that we\\'ve binged it because we watched it as it came out, but Falcon and the Winter Soldier, it was very big in our house. The final episode was Friday.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOh, nice.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Parent 4. Let\\'s see, I\\'ve been binging a lot of stuff, but I guess the one that\\'s been pretty cool lately is Raised By Wolves.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOh, wow. Okay.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:10:56] I\\'m Parent 5 and I don\\'t really watch TV, so don\\'t binge that much.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nA good book, then?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nNo, I\\'ve been, watching on, I think it\\'s Netflix, Castle, with my son.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy name is [Parent 1 Sing 00:11:14] and I also don\\'t unfortunately have the time to watch a lot of TV. But I don\\'t know, I guess something I recently watched was The College Admissions Scandal documentary on Netflix. That was recent.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nGreat. All right, so in thinking about technology and its use, I want to try to get as many opinions today as possible and get feedback. We don\\'t need to all agree with each other, I like it when we don\\'t or we have differing views. But I like to try and exercise where we talk about, or you think about some of the ways technology has been useful during the pandemic and some of the ways it has been problematic during the pandemic.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIf you just take a minute, write down three of the positives, three of the negatives, and then let\\'s circle one from each group that was the most important. And then overall, which one wins over it. For example, if I had to think about technology use with my children during the pandemic, some of the positives where they\\'ve developed better skills, technologically they use it to call family a lot. And it also gave me time to work because it kept them busy.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSome of the problematic parts were the endless playing of games, hard to manage bedtimes and the whining when it wasn\\'t technology time. I would probably say the whining was the worst of the problematic side and the letting me work was the best of the positive side. But overall, I would say positive had to win. We\\'ll just take a two minutes and do that part.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n(silence).\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIf you\\'re done, just raise your hand so I know everyone\\'s sort of finishing.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n(silence).\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAll right, who wants to go first?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI can go first. I think I had similar challenges to yours. I think I had similar challenges to yours but I said it helps us stay connected. Even though we\\'re going through this pandemic, we were able to stay connected with our friends, our families. We can continue to do our work, whether it be schoolwork or our own adult work and just helped us be more creative about it.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAnd for myself, my kids are pretty tech savvy, but for me, I feel like I wasn\\'t. And I think this gave me an opportunity to really kind of expand on my small tech skills, so those were my three pros.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAnd then, the cons were, yes, the endless playing of games. I\\'m just constantly finding myself, asking them to please try doing other things, read a book, take a break, something. But if I let them, there\\'ll be on video games all day and it\\'s been difficult to monitor also because, even though we have like a policy that everybody has to give up their devices at a certain time, they still found ways around it, you know? And the other thing is that I just find myself, it\\'s just a point of contention now. We\\'re just negotiating, constantly renegotiating and negotiating those things. Those were my cons.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. Anybody else want to share?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI can share. We have Similar issues. I have an 11 year old and a 16 year old. I would say, the overwhelming negative for everybody in the house is just way, way, way too much screen time and just really hard to... and I\\'ve never been good at managing the screen time. The only way I was ever able to do it was to just say like, \"No screen time during the week on a school night and screen time as much as you want on the weekends.\"\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNow, because they need screens to do their homework, like trying to keep them from not, if you walk out of the room and you walk back in and like, they\\'re playing my Minecraft or if not, it\\'s on a hidden screen or whatever. You\\'re like, oh, so my coping mechanism, of just saying all or nothing is kind of taken away now. Yeah, way too much screen time for everybody, me included.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'d say the biggest plus has been so many artists have found new ways of getting their art out to people, whether that\\'s book illustrators or musical concerts. There\\'s one band we would love to see become, maybe once a year, once every two years. And he\\'s been doing a weekly concert every Saturday. That\\'s a really nice thing that normally an artist we would only get to see once a year, we get to see every Saturday. And artists like Oliver Jeffers or Mo Willems or things like that, you know, doing really fun art related things has been fun.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. Does anybody else want to share?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI can go. For the negatives on us, there\\'s definitely been, it\\'s the exact same thing just way too much screen time for everybody in the family, not just for the kids. You just kind of find yourself kind of, especially at certain points of the year when locked down was stricter, just bored. And so, all of us are on our phones or in front of the TV or on the computer.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd my two are 14 and 10, so for the 14 year old, he\\'s already kind of going through those teenage mood swings. And I have found that the extra screen time hasn\\'t helped, like on days when he has less screen time, he\\'s in a better mood overall. When he goes over a certain amount and he\\'s just kind of a dick. And then, it\\'s also been like disrupted sleep and trying to figure out what the best time to cut it off is so that they\\'re not staying up too late and they\\'re able to fall asleep without being all edgy.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOn the positives, both of my boys have ADHD and while they\\'re both really smart, like getting them to focus in class has always been an issue. While they\\'ve been home and everything is laid out on the computer, their grades have skyrocketed, they\\'re both currently on principal\\'s list. Both of them have had nothing but nineties throughout the year. And I know a lot of parents have struggled with that transition to working from home.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut for us, it actually worked really well because I was able to be like, \"Hey, let\\'s put you in a quiet environment and there\\'s no distractions at the moment and you sit there and I\\'ll sit here and do my work and you sit there and you do yours. And if you need help, you let me know.\" And because it\\'s quiet and there\\'s nothing else going around, they\\'ve been able to focus, so that\\'s really been great for them as far as just grades.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd then, the other one as a family that we\\'ve enjoyed is because we\\'re not going out as much, the one time that I really do enjoy the screen time is when I\\'m like, \"Hey, let\\'s do family movie night.\" And our pod was us and then my mom and my aunt. We\\'d do like a whole thing. We\\'d bring down the screen, we\\'d make popcorn and it would just feel really great to sit there as a family and have our own little moment where we were all connecting.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s good. Thank you. Does anyone else want to share now? Or should we go ahead with questions?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can just add a little bit.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI guess a couple other things is to add what to people have already said is the positive has been things like I\\'ve been able to go to PTA meetings and stuff, which I wasn\\'t able to always attend in the past. And keeping in touch with, well, when the pandemic started, it seemed like we were making more of an effort to FaceTime with family in India, and have all the cousins together.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd now, obviously a year into it, that\\'s lessening a little bit. But in the beginning, there was this wanting to get together and actually FaceTiming people, which we hadn\\'t done in a long time. And then, the negative is obviously the endless addiction that people have talked about, but also this concern that, are they going to be able to function as like normal humans like you and I function? Or do the only way they know how to communicate with their friends is when they have a phone in their hands? There\\'s this fear that this kind of alternative way of communication has seeped in.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThank you, that\\'s all great insight, actually. In terms of some of the questions we wanted to talk through today, I want to start with in terms of your children and their use of technology for education, the first question we\\'re focusing mostly on prior to the pandemic, what was that like?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSure, for us, prior to the pandemic, most of their technology use for school was at school. They didn\\'t bring, like they have their Chromebooks, they didn\\'t bring their Chromebooks home, generally. They use pen and paper for their things. Sometimes they\\'d have to look things up on the computer, but it wasn\\'t the larger part of their schoolwork at home. But now, it\\'s the complete opposite. If he\\'s writing, if either one of them is writing anything down, it\\'s actually surprising more than anything.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBoth of my sons have an IEP with assistive technology. My 16 year old is actually very adept at using a computer beforehand and his school was already using Classroom about a year ahead of time. For him, it was a pretty seamless transition and like Parent 2 said as well, with ADHD, for him, for my 16 year old, it\\'s been an improvement being at home. Sometimes, being in an ICT classroom is great for kids with ADHD, but sometimes it can be tricky because sometimes you have more disruptive kids in there and makes it a little harder for him to concentrate. On that aspect, it\\'s been better. And my 11 year old had been given assistive technology, but had never really been shown how to use it. He didn\\'t really use it at home at all. But now, he could probably run a small tech company. They\\'ve gotten very good at it.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s great.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy high schooler was already using the technology, so he\\'s using it even more now. Whereas, I think it was with my middle schoolers, it\\'s like Parent 2, it was like more pen and paper for him. And now, yeah, he, I barely see him using pen and paper, he\\'s mostly on some device for his schoolwork.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, the same for me, the pen and paper has disappeared. And personally, I consider that a loss because I just feel like their going to forget how to write.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSo true.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nWith my son, it was a natural transition. There wasn\\'t much of a transition cause he was already using the computer to write all his reports and even well, the math is of course still pencil and paper. I don\\'t think he\\'s doing that. I see him doing that on paper still and then he takes snapshots of it and sends it to the teacher. But otherwise, it wasn\\'t much of a transition at all. He is doing very well in school, too, but no real transition.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay, and in terms of using technology during the pandemic, what was that like for your family?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWell, they were on screens pretty much all day, like they logged on at 8:00 or whatever, then whatever school ended 3:00 and then they just stayed on doing homework or God knows what else. But they were just in front of the screen from 8:00 to, you have to like sort of drag them away for dinner. But it was just all encompassing.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nIt just seems like they\\'re on the computer all the time. And you don\\'t really know if they\\'re goofing off or not, as long as grades are okay, I guess he\\'s doing what he has to be doing. We kind of let him do his own thing.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. Anybody else?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'d say for us, the experience is just pretty Similar. I mean, the little one is in class starting in at 8:30. Really, we get them up and we start, they have Zoom classes certain times throughout the day. And then, during the rest of the day while he\\'s not in Zoom classes, he has assignments that have to be completed and turned in preferably by 4:00. We\\'ll get them up as early as 7:30 so he can start getting the work out of the way. And once he\\'s done with that he\\'s like, \"Hey, can I go watch this?\" Or, \"Hey, can I go play a video game?\" I\\'m like, \"How about you try to read for a half hour first and then, you know, give your brain a break from the computer?\" But it\\'s essentially the same for both of them is they jump on first thing and then it\\'s pretty much straight through the day unless you rip them away from it.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy middle schooler has a regular day, so it\\'s just all online. He starts at 9:00 and ends at 3:00. He\\'s basically, with the exception of the lunch break that he gets, he\\'s in front of the screen most of the day. And I think just like Parent 1 said, it kind of evolves from one thing to the next, because then even after school, he\\'s still in front of the screen, whether it\\'s doing homework, chatting with his friends or playing video games. I find myself having to come in and make him take breaks away from the screen, whether it\\'s just go eat something or just go to the bathroom. I don\\'t know because yeah, he\\'ll just sit in there while my high schooler, his schedule is different. But I feel like he manages his time better because he has to go from his regular high school classes and his College Now classes. He has two different schedules to follow. But I think for my middle school, it\\'s just been harder to kind of get him away from the screen.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah. We have I\\'d say a Similar thing. Our high schooler has kind of figured it out and manages his time well. And the tricky thing for our older one, our kids first got phones in sixth grade and we had one computer in the living room that everyone could use. We haven\\'t been able to do that with our current sixth grader. He\\'s gotten a lot more screen time a lot more quickly. He got his first phone starting in sixth grade, but he certainly has much more access to screens than his brother did at the same age. All the sort of safeguards and things we had in place for our now 16 year old are out the window with the 11 year old.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd he starts class at 9:00, but he\\'ll get up at 7:30 in the morning to play Minecraft or Subnautica or whatever before school starts. And so, okay, he\\'s getting up in the morning, he does that. But it\\'s a lot of computer time during the day.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI\\'m sure. Does anyone else want to share around that?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI find that it\\'s harder for me to control what they\\'re doing, especially those well, I have a four year old and I have a 10 year old. One is in fifth grade, the fifth grader is a little more responsible as the kindergarten, pre-K say, my four year old son. My four year old son would not stay still. He would not want to be in the sessions and he would cry, whine and we\\'re having a difficult time sitting him down for more than what? Maybe they meet like an hour. That\\'s been tough.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. And what challenges do you all anticipate in your children going back to school full-time?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nFor me, I worry about because they were both ADHD, they both already kind of struggled with connecting with their peers. And so, there\\'s been almost a full year now where they really haven\\'t connected with kids in their own age. They just recently started going back to Taekwondo for in-person classes, so they\\'re starting to see their peers and stuff, but I worry about their relationships and making friends.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nEspecially for my oldest, he started, this was his first year of high school, so when he goes back in September, he\\'ll be going into the 10th grade. But he was already going in without knowing anybody, so I worry that he will especially struggle to make those connections and know how to carry out conversations in person and how to hang out without a screen in their face.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI have the same concern with Parent 5, Child 1 right now. I know he\\'s struggling with that at school. He goes to a boarding school, but they have the option to stay home and do Zoom also. And he actually, for the first time, he\\'s very... He used to, well, he\\'s always been very sociable, but this is his first year in high school, too, so he changed from schools, too. He went into a school where he knew nobody and then just half the school is actually there in person.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nAnd about a month ago, he asked to come home and I said to my husband, I go, \"This is the first time he\\'s ever asked to come home. He\\'s always loved being in a boarding student.\" And I found that very strange. He wasn\\'t talking to us very much. I found that he was isolating himself a lot, but he\\'s going through that teenage period. You\\'re like, \"Okay, is he just going through a phase?\" And it finally did come out that it was the social aspect of the school that he was just feeling very lonely and very isolated. And I think because everybody is on their screens everywhere and they\\'re not socializing. I think it\\'s going to be an issue, I think, with the kids overall, whether they have problems or not.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nVery hard. I want to shift into talking a little bit about your child\\'s use of social media. And we\\'ll start with a Similar set of questions. What was your child\\'s use of social media like prior to the pandemic? Did you find it beneficial? Did you find it problematic? What were your thoughts around that?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSorry, just to interject, I know for some parents or some kids your children may not use social media. If that\\'s the case, you can also talk about just any media use such as like YouTube or like watching and things like that.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWe don\\'t let our kids do traditional social media, no Facebook, no Instagram, no anything like that. Again, I did find it a lot easier to do this with my older son. My younger son is on YouTube a lot. As much as you try to monitor it, they will always find a way around it. There\\'s just no, there\\'s just no way. And the worst is Discord. We\\'ve found discord to be incredibly problematic and really, really hard to monitor. And the tricky part about it is, it is, I think at least for my sons, it\\'s like the main way kids were communicating with each other, because you can be on a group chat with your class with your advisory, with different things, so it has functional uses. You can\\'t just say, \"No Discord,\" which is what I would like to do.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBut, having to constantly monitor all the different threads on Discord and trying to figure out Discord because I\\'m not a big social media user myself, so trying to figure out that stuff and what\\'s okay to use and what\\'s not. And my son also struggles being social, so I didn\\'t want to cut off a social avenue. But I really, really dislike Discord.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI would say I\\'m very Similar to Parent 3 in that sense. I didn\\'t let the boys get phones. The little one got a phone now because of everything going on. But Parent 2, Child 1, my oldest didn\\'t get his phone until his his 14th birthday this past summer because it was like, well, we gave it to him as an early graduation gift because he was going to be going to high school and the high school was so much further from our home than where his middle school was.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHis middle school was a 15 minute walk from our place, the high school, he\\'s actually going to, when he goes in, person is actually like a train ride and a bus ride away. At that point, we gave him the phone so he could get like phone numbers for all his friends that he wanted to stay in contact with from middle school and that kind of thing. But we had a strict no classic social media, no Facebook, no Instagram, no Snapchat, none of that.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd we told the older one that when he got his phone, if he was interested in Instagram, because I felt like, okay, it\\'s a little bit easier to monitor Instagram than it is some of the other social media you can get and he wasn\\'t interested. But now, as this time has gone on, they\\'ve been interested in Discord and it actually started with group play on things like Roblox and stuff like that. That\\'s how it started for them. But it is a lot harder to monitor. And the little one, not so much that he\\'s 10, so there\\'s a lot of YouTube, which I\\'m not crazy about, but at least I can sit in the room and kind of keep an eye on the YouTube with them and see what he\\'s watching.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut the Discord is really, really hard to keep track of and is kind of a concern for me because like, \"Who are you talking to? Who are you?\" You know what I mean? Like you\\'re meeting all these people in these rooms and you\\'re communicating and he\\'s like, \"Oh, I made a friend and you know, wherever, and they\\'re my age.\" And I\\'m like, \"That stranger danger talk of internet stuff is like consistent.\" Like, \"Hey, remember they\\'re saying they\\'re your age, but you\\'re not seeing them in person. Anybody can say anything. You know? It\\'s also, be careful about what you\\'re putting out there. You know, just because somebody asks for X, Y, and Z doesn\\'t mean you have to whatever. Don\\'t give pictures of yourselves, don\\'t give locations of yourselves, that kind of stuff.\" There\\'s a lot of whole new world for me, stepping into this because it pushed it forward so fast.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s a great point.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah, I feel like we\\'re having a Similar experience, too. And I feel like my younger son has had just way more access to social media in comparison to my older childs now with the pandemic and they\\'re big video, big PlayStation gamers, so they have a lot more access than I\\'m comfortable with, but we\\'ve also had to go over the not giving out your personal information, not giving, putting your business out there with these people because you really don\\'t know them.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAnd also, just talking about just being caring, being careful, being cautious, not everybody\\'s your friends type thing, but yeah, there\\'s a lot of access with the YouTube, with the gaming. They\\'re not on Facebook, thankfully, but they\\'re on other things, they\\'re on Instagram, they\\'re on TikTok so it\\'s just, I\\'m very concerned about the younger one because I feel like he\\'s still trying to figure things out while at least the older one didn\\'t, wasn\\'t exposed to these things until more recently. But he wants to do everything has big brother\\'s doing, the younger one, so that\\'s been a challenge for me.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, just chiming in, the Discord is an issue for us, as well. It seems to have taken over and he seems to be communicating kind of nonstop to this universe out there. And again, can\\'t really monitor what threads, what rooms or whatever that he\\'s in, but he seems to be almost, I mean, tied to the hip to this, to this Discord. Like he seems to be responding every couple of minutes to some kind of message board or something. And I\\'ve never seen anything like that before. And that\\'s really, really concerning, like it seems to have taken over his life.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI\\'m sure. And you\\'ve addressed sort of prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic, what are your thoughts on as we return to in-person school and in-person activities, what your children\\'s use of either social media or things like YouTube and Discord and other things on their devices will be like?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nFor us, I figure we\\'re probably going to have a little bit of a fight on our hands. I\\'m already trying to push them more towards like so for like the summer I got my older one to apply to and enroll in two different activities. And they\\'re both going to be Zoom, but it\\'s Zoom with like people, you know what I mean? One is almost like a book group that he\\'s gonna join. And the other one is a coding camp type of thing. And it means less time on things like Discord and stuff like that. I figure while it\\'s not in-person, at least it\\'s, it\\'s interacting. It\\'s more like this setup versus just typing in a chat room and being in front of the computer screen by yourself. And I\\'ve already been pushing him to do that now.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI made him join a book group that he goes to twice a month and it\\'s always like a fight because he\\'s always like, \"Well, I\\'m just doing this on the computer.\" And I\\'m like, \"No, shut it down and go join your Zoom.:\" I figure that if I\\'m having that much trouble with a 45 minute thing once a week, I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s going to be like when I\\'m like, \"Hey, go hang out with people.\" Which is funny because like, when I was growing up, it was my mom going, \"Stop hanging out so much.\" And now I\\'m like, \"Go outside, go meet someone, like take the train or something.\" And I worry a little bit because it has engulfed him so much, he is so comfortable and settled in that I know it\\'s going to be difficult to pull him away from that.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI agree with that. I give you a small example, like if it was my son\\'s birthday, this is the younger one on Saturday. And I was like, \"Okay, so why don\\'t we go out, go eat.\" He loves hamburgers, so I said, \"Let\\'s go, let\\'s go to a burger place.\"\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAnd he was like, \"No, I just want to stay home and play with my friends online.\" And I was like, \"Oh, my God, that broke my heart.\" I was like, \"Dude, we need to go outside, get some fresh air.\" I had to force him just to take an hour outside, get some air, eat because like he\\'s just breathing internet. I just feel like going back to school, that that transition is going to pretty intense, pretty difficult because they just want to be online all the time now.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYep, they\\'re not very physical anymore. It\\'s very, very hard. You have to bribe them, trick them guilt them into it. It\\'s a challenge. It\\'s a constant challenge every day, trying to get them to be physical and go outside and look at the sun, sit out there and get some vitamin D. It\\'s very hard.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s true. What are some other thoughts on their use of social media, YouTube devices, and around the more in-person activities? Because the struggle is really challenging. It\\'s hard because I think a lot of kids have gotten very used to some of these things. Switching back, I think will be a challenge.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI think it will be a challenge. I know Parent 5, Child 1, I was kind of surprised, he actually verbalized, \"Mom, it\\'s not the same talking to someone through social media as it is to talk to someone in person.\" He knows it\\'s not like a true human interaction. There\\'s some kind of falsehood to it. A lot of pretend going and there\\'s not as much work in that relationship through social media, as there is through a real face-to-face relationship with somebody.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThat was good that he actually is knowledgeable of that difference. How he\\'ll interact and face-to-face is a big question because like I said before, he wanted to come home. I don\\'t know whether the kids that he\\'s socializing with are having the same issue, that nobody is socializing with them or is he having the issue, socializing with others? That\\'s my question. Maybe it\\'s a little bit of both from both sides.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt might be, have you been to him about those challenges?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI have. I\\'ve asked about his friends, like who was he hanging out with? What do they do? What are their interests? Like I said, he just moved from the middle school to the high school, so all the kids are different. I mean, there was not one kid that\\'s going to the same high school as he is. It\\'s a whole new school to begin with, but everybody\\'s starting in the ninth grade, so they\\'re all coming from different areas of the country and going to that school.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThey\\'re basically all in the same boat together, but it seems like social media did, has done something to, I don\\'t know. It\\'s very difficult for these kids to interact, to really interact. I go, \"What do you all do in the evenings?\" He\\'s like, \"Oh, well, you know, like his roommate gets on the computer.\" He\\'s a big techie guy and Parent 5, Child 1 tries not to, but it does, it\\'s really hard not to when everybody else is in their rooms doing something on their social media.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWe have a Similar issue with our sixth grader. He started a new school this year, middle school, and he was the only one from his elementary school to go to that middle school. And there were a number of students that have come sort of in large, larger groups from other schools, so there are kids that do know each other, even though everyone is starting sixth grade.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBut, and I do find that that\\'s often used as a, I would say a point of manipulation if you try to limit Discord or screen time, like, \"Those are my only friends, it\\'s the only contact I have with people and you want to take it away from me.\" And, and there\\'s, I\\'ve done a lot of defensiveness around any kind of discussion that the internet may not be God given gift to humanity.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWe tried to watch a movie about, or there was a TV, like a 20/20 or 60 minutes or something about like screen time in America. And I was like, \"Well, why don\\'t we watch this together? And you guys can tell me what you think.\" And they\\'re like, \"Oh, you just want to take away our screen time.\" They were just like, wouldn\\'t hear it, wouldn\\'t even listen to it. Totally, this was like, \"You\\'re old, you just don\\'t get it.\" And how important it is to us.\"\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt really is so challenging, you know? What gains or what positives do you think you hope to see continue?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThe only positive I see is this ability to keep in touch with people. But in my opinion, and I guess these skills that they\\'re learning are kind of necessary for their future. But in my opinion, I think the negatives outweigh the positives.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nTotally agree.\\n\\nSpeaker:\\n\\nI\\'m going to have to agree with that, as well.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah, I agree.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd I\\'m going to ask you a question. Maybe we\\'re the dinosaurs here, maybe the moms in the group were the dinosaurs, and this is gonna be the new pParent 3digm and this is going to be how their brains kind of transform and I don\\'t know, societal habits transform and work this fighting it. I don\\'t know. I\\'m unclear about that. But I just, I know that I don\\'t like the direction in which it\\'s going.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI mean, I think it is very challenging. I have three children and they have, or I have struggled with their use of technology during the pandemic, as well. I mentioned it earlier and switching to, my children are 13 and almost 10 and almost eight. They\\'re all, they\\'re younger. My son who\\'s seven, barely remembers even going to regular school because he started first grade and then was in school until March and then they switched to Zoom only, which, I mean, he got nothing less, like literally nothing less than nothing, maybe. I don\\'t know.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nBecause, I work and they are in, doing their thing and I can\\'t necessarily police him all day. And as I think a lot of parents are struggling with what their children get out of a Zoom class at seven years old and keeping someone on Zoom for, he goes to a private school. Hours and hours a day, even with breaks, even with schedules and everything else, it was a negotiation process. And I cannot tell you how many times I busted both of my sons not on their Zoom class, but watching YouTube instead. And it\\'s funny because something I struggle with is not necessarily the social media, but this endless watching of other people playing a game. I don\\'t understand-\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI don\\'t understand that, either.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I\\'m fascinated [crosstalk 00:51:48].\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s the worst. It\\'s almost worst than the playing.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThe worst. Yeah, just play. It is worse.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m like, \"Do something, like you\\'re not doing anything, you\\'re sitting there watching somebody play a game.\" It drives me crazy.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nMe, too. Me, too.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAnd then, they-\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd then, of course, they\\'re like, \"Mom, you just don\\'t understand.\" And I\\'m like, \"You\\'re right. I don\\'t understand [crosstalk 00:52:07].\"\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing to understand, I don\\'t think. I don\\'t think there is. Maybe I\\'m too old, also, but there\\'s nothing to understand. It\\'s watching someone else play a game. I don\\'t know. I can\\'t figure out what is fascinating about that. It would drive me to literal insanity.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMy 10 year old is here and he overheard that and he\\'s just looking at me like... Get out of here, God away.\\n\\nParent 2, Child 1:\\n\\nNever. I will stay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nGo.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nMy ten-year-old very much, though. I ask them constantly why? And there is no answer or none that [crosstalk 00:52:44].\\n\\nParent 2, Child 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s just for fun. Some games you can\\'t play.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHe\\'s like, \"It\\'s just because it\\'s fun.\" I don\\'t, I don\\'t, put your earphones back on and watch your movie.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nTake your word for it. I have this conversation with my kids and then I\\'m like, \"You know what, fine, forget it. I\\'ll take your word for it.\" But, it\\'s kind of a fascinating thing I think to watch this development. Because I\\'m like, \"You\\'re not even playing, like at least play the game,\" but they\\'ll watch Minecraft or Roblox, someone playing another game. And I\\'m like, I don\\'t even know what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd they\\'ll watch for hours, if you let them.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAnd then, the funniest was my seven and nine-year-old both. I did not allow them to have YouTube channels or an account, but without my noticing, the school posts some of their classes. And so, they have a school email address and were able to create an account on YouTube using their school email addresses. And then, they created these, I can only call them idiotic videos of a attempt at them playing a game. And they were like all disappointed they have no views. And I was like, \"Because it\\'s terrible, like who would watch this? It\\'s not funny. It\\'s nothing, you\\'re just watching someone like a screen.\"\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAnd then, they\\'ve figured it out. And so, they watch my nephews and my nephew watches theirs now until I found out about all the accounts and now they\\'re all done. Look, I think it\\'s a struggle. I think a lot of everyone struggles with this because if you were trying to control device time prior to the pandemic, I think a huge struggle is that there wasn\\'t really an option to necessarily control it during and going back to it, I think is, it was really hard.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI think trying to say like, \"Oh, so we were allowed to use devices every day of the week, you used to be allowed to use them on weekends, so then it turned into seven days a week and oh, by the way, school, you\\'re back in school now, give me your iPad.\" And you can\\'t even say it now because I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know about your experiences, but my children are back in school and over the last couple of months, I can\\'t even tell you how many times, like a teacher was exposed, a kid in another class was exposed to it, a sibling in their class.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAnd so, they shut down each grade for two weeks constantly and so it\\'s not like I could take away the iPads and say, \"Well, no more iPads now.\" It\\'s just a constant battle, I wonder, I think as we return to a greater sense of normalcy it\\'ll be challenging at best to limit children\\'s use of devices. The way I think about it is, I was, I don\\'t know, not even at my second job, probably my third before I got a smartphone and most of us I\\'m assuming on this call have a smartphone, an iPhone, a Galaxy something. And if someone said to you, you had to go back to a flip phone tomorrow or you had to go back to a beeper, what would your response be?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI would love it.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI know, right? Part of you would-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'m so sick of it. They\\'re days I leave my phone by accident and I\\'m like, \"Oh, it\\'s so nice, like, this is what it used to be like and no one could reach you.\"\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nBut if you think about it, if you are out shopping and your child finds an item in a store, in a Target and hands it, says, \"I want it,\" and it\\'s actually decent and your first instinct is to reach for your phone, search it on Amazon. Is it cheaper? Am I going to save money on...? If you had no... like we use devices for so many different things, a text, a call someone reaching out to you, seeing a post on Facebook, all of those things are, become part of our just general schema. And so, it\\'s hard to just tell kids like, \"Oh, it\\'s fine for me, but it\\'s not fine for you.\" You know?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWell, what\\'s interesting is I\\'m just now reading The Scaffold Effect, I was recommended because right. You guys were sending that out. And it\\'s on the chapter on like screen use and it\\'s like, \"Kids should only be you know, using the screens two hours a day,\" and I\\'m like, \"Okay, Mr. Koplewicz, that\\'s not happening.\" I\\'m like, \"Who is managing two hours a day?\"\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI would love, I would love to manage three or four hours a day, right?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI know, I know. Every time that like your average daily screen use, I\\'m like, I don\\'t want to see it. I don\\'t want to see it. I don\\'t want to see my kids. I just, I don\\'t need to see they\\'re all averaging like 10 hours a day.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nDefinitely is pretty funny.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOne thing that we did for us that has been sort of working is at least one weekend day now that the weather is starting to warm up for the last two or three weekends, we\\'ve gone out for the day. And all they hate it. They hate it so much until they don\\'t. But I\\'m like, \"Hey, we\\'re going to go for a walk and we\\'re going to go to this bookstore and we\\'re going to maybe we\\'ll grab lunch somewhere and let\\'s go to the park. And even if we just sit on a bench and you know,\" and so for a few hours, depending on how long, this past weekend, we ended up staying out much longer than we expected. And we were all exhausted, but it also kind of felt so good because we were outside and not in front of a screen.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd at first they were like, \"When are we going back? I was hoping to get on a game with my,\" and I\\'m like, \"I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if we\\'re going back anytime soon.\" But it\\'s helped.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:58:57] go back.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, I don\\'t know. Like, I don\\'t know if we\\'re returning, it\\'s never, we\\'re never going back, but it kind of by the end of it, they were talking and, \"Oh, look at this and hey, you know, can we go here?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, absolutely. You want to go to Barnes & Noble? Yeah. I\\'ll take you to Barnes & Noble. You want to look at a book? Sure.\" You know? I\\'m like anything to like, keep you from being in front of a screen and to have you physically moving. And so, that helped.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd I was like, \"Hey, maybe next weekend we can find someplace with like an easy hike, because like we\\'re all like stiff and unused to moving and have like an extra 15, 20 pounds. Like all of us like from the littlest to the oldest, we\\'re all just like round now.\" And I\\'m like, \"Maybe we can start walking and get some of that roundness out.\" And they\\'re like, \"Yeah. Okay. I guess.\" But at least I can get them to try it. They\\'re not crazy about it, but they\\'ll do it, so it gives us something that\\'s not sitting in front of the screen.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s great. It\\'s a great idea. Does anyone have any closing thoughts before we wrap up for today?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI have to say I\\'m looking forward to them going back to school full-time. Just because I think that will naturally on its own decrease the screen time. As long as they were not just Zooming in class, which is so frustrating. But yeah, I\\'m definitely looking forward to them going back.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI agree. Right now, my son goes to school in person one day a week and I\\'m always grateful for that day. Not only is it a break for me because I don\\'t have to be on edge and feel like I have to keep checking in to make sure he\\'s on the right screen, not kind of being distracted by other things. But I think it makes, it forces him to kind of be around the other kids and talk. Because he really has no interest in doing that.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI think back to when he was younger and getting speech services, how they\\'d always talk about things like pragmatics, that, that reciprocal conversation, the eye contact and like that\\'s gone with all the devices and everything. It\\'s something that kids are going to have to almost relearn once they\\'re face to face, on a more consistent basis.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, I mean, I think so many of the kids with the IEPs, all those services are just out the window. I mean, my son had his first year after years and years of trying to get them OT finally got it. And then, it was cut off last March and nothing since then. He was supposed to be an ICT class, that\\'s not happening. And that\\'s the other part is being in a position of being parent, teacher, screen monitor. It has not been good for our relationship. Having to sit there in his, and do my work in the same room that he\\'s in, because if I walk out, he\\'s not, he doesn\\'t know what\\'s going on in class. He doesn\\'t, so I have to stay in the same room to make sure that he\\'s at least in the Zoom classroom of the class that he\\'s in.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd so, like any independence that he would have gained this year has just gone. And now that he is going back hybrid, like when he\\'s in school, nothing gets done. They\\'ve tried to do it so all work gets done during the school day and they don\\'t have extra homework after school. But they said he\\'s in school now, nothing gets done because he just, he doesn\\'t have somebody sitting there again, \"Are you in the class? Are you on the right Zoom? Are you opening the right files?\"\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nComplete learned helplessness at home, which is entirely my fault, but I don\\'t, I haven\\'t managed to figure out that bridge of making sure he gets the information and understands what\\'s going on, but is independent and can do stuff on his own. We decided on making sure he knows the information so that if they have to build on that information next year, but yeah, the independence, non-existent.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI totally get it. All right, we have to wrap up for today. Administrator, you want to update everyone on compensation and where to go from here?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah, so first, thank you guys so... Oh, sorry, it froze from my end by thank you guys so much for your participation today in the focus group. All of the information that you guys gave us today was really helpful. Especially, about Discord. This is the first group. I don\\'t know, Moderator 2, if you can agree-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYeah, I haven\\'t heard it before.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThis is the first group that we\\'ve heard about Discord. We usually hear about like Roblox, YouTube, Minecraft, things like that, Instagram. We should definitely look more into Discord, so thank you guys so much for that information.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIn regards to compensation, you guys should get it no later than Wednesday. As soon as this is over, I\\'m going to send our administrator your information and you should expect to receive the $50 Amazon gift card through email. By Wednesday, if you don\\'t receive it, please do not hesitate to either email me or give me a phone call and we can work that out.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAll right. Great. Thank you so much, everyone.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 01:04:56] everyone.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nBye-bye.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nTake care, everyone.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAdministrator, can I ask you a question?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThis is sort of a sepParent 3te question from this. I don\\'t know if you could answer it. It\\'s sort of a general question after doing the thing last year with my son doing the study, do you know for like looking for a referral for a not extremely an expensive available therapist that would deal with like learning disabilities, ADHD, particularly?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIf we have-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nLike a referral or something?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:05:43] you said it\\'s for learning?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nLike when he like specifically, ADHD.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nGot it. I can reach out to the clinician who, I\\'m so sorry about outside.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNo worries.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nOut to clinician who worked on your report, because might have, we have like a referral bank where all clinicians pull from.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nI\\'ll reach out to your clinician because they would have a better scope of just [crosstalk 01:06:19].\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSense of, right.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAnd they\\'ll be able to kind of help with referrals. What I will suggest is I\\'m gonna reach out to them right now. By Friday, if you don\\'t hear from me, definitely email me about it so that I can keep on top of that.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAwesome. Thank you so much.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nOf course. No problem.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAppreciate it. Oh, yeah. And definitely look into Discord. It\\'s evil.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah, this is so interesting. I feel like every new group we hear about something new, but this is literally the first time we\\'ve heard about Discord, so this is definitely [crosstalk 01:06:57] we should, you know-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nIt\\'s a problem.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBecause the thing is, like any of the old, old five years ago, things that you could do, like there were programs 360, whatever, like various things that you could like, it would literally give you a report at the end of the day or the end of the week and would basically give you all the information that went out of your kids\\' phones.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nIt could tell you like every text, every email, every whatever. And because Discord is web-based, you can\\'t do that. And it\\'s also voice and it\\'s meant to be a room, it\\'s meant to be a digital room where you could play a game together or you could watch a movie together and there are great social uses for it. And a lot of classes are using it. A lot of artists are using it.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBut I mean, trying to figure it out, as a parent, trying to keep up with all the different apps. And I feel like my husband and I have done a pretty good job of staying on top of all those things. But Discord has me stumped. I mean, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever seen it, but like you open it up and there are just rooms and rooms and rooms and to try to click in and follow some of the conversations and everybody has screen names. Even if like you know, this is made up of his classmates, you don\\'t know which one is which.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nIf there\\'s bullying or something going on, like it\\'s just really hard to stay on top of. But it\\'s also hard to say like absolute no to.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nDifferent classes are using.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nBut the schools are using it. Yeah.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nKids are using it to stay in touch with classmates. And in my older son\\'s class, they have a whole, their section, their class section uses Discord because it\\'s a very easy way to chat with each other and talk with each other in real time. It\\'s bad.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nNo, but thank you for this. I just wrote down everything that you told me. I\\'m going to bring it to our team so that we can, I guess learn about it some more. And this might be some good information that we might be able to provide you guys when we have the town hall meeting in May or June.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nMaybe there is a way to kind of like figure out how to navigate it as a parent. I\\'ve never heard of it, so I\\'m definitely going to look into it myself just to see how it works.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, and a lot of my friends use it and they like it for certain things. Yeah. If you\\'re following a band and you\\'re listening to a concert together and you\\'re all texting each other it\\'s kind of like a way to be together. But it\\'s very easy to be abused.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAll right. Well, thank you so much.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nThank you. Yeah, if you don\\'t hear back from me by Friday, definitely do not hesitate to email me or give me a call.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI\\'ll keep working on my scaffold.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIt\\'s so crazy because I haven\\'t even started reading the book yet, so when you mentioned it, I just looked right across from me at where the book is.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI got to tell you, I got the book. I pre-ordered it, so I got it when it first came out and it\\'s been sitting on my desk and sitting on my desk and finally I just ordered it on Audible because I get a year subscription. And I was like, \"You know what? I am just going to get it on Audible.\" And I listened to it on like one and a half speed, so it\\'s been a good way to do it. I\\'m like on, on Chapter seven now, or Chapter six. But yeah, it\\'s definitely gotten to the internet chapter. And I\\'m like, this was very much written pre-pandemic and not edited for the pandemic because a lot of this stuff is out the window right now.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd there\\'s a lot of it that\\'s like, \"Well, my kids are 11 and 16, so I think I\\'ve already screwed up the scaffold.\" I\\'m beyond, I\\'m starting the scaffold in the middle of the building.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIn the middle of a global pandemic, as well.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nA pandemic, I know. Oh, man. I\\'m like, oops, nope, missed that one. Nope, didn\\'t do that one, either.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nOh, my gosh.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThe first chapter was like, oh, maybe I shouldn\\'t even read this because I\\'m so far behind. Some things I feel like we\\'ve done, but other things I\\'m like, \"Yeah, what about like, let\\'s get to the part where your kids are not in the four to seven, four to 12 year old bracket.\"\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd like what you can do now.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah, definitely.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAll right. Thank you so much.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nNo problem. Thank you for your time today.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAll right. Take care.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nOkay. Bye-bye.'b'Moderator 1:\\n\\nWe\\'re just going to wait for a couple more people to sign on, but we\\'re going to get started soon.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIn the mean time if you don\\'t have a paper and pencil nearby, maybe just grab one because it\\'ll be helpful for something. Thanks.\\n\\n\\tHi Administrator.\\n\\nAdministrator:  \\n\\nHi.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo, I just told everyone we\\'ll get started in a few minutes. How many people are we expecting today?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSix.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSix? Okay, great.\\n\\n\\tThanks for waiting everyone. We\\'ll wait a couple more minutes and then we can just get started and if more people join then they can jump in, in the middle.\\n\\n\\tHi, welcome.\\n\\nAdministrator: \\n\\nOh hi.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:05:27] Parent 2, I think you might be connected twice.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNow I don\\'t have my photo. I was trying to get on and use the tablet instead of my phone.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh well maybe you could do that and maybe just mute the one that\\'s the picture?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay that sounds good.\\n\\n\\tOh my God. I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, it\\'s okay Parent 2. Now if you just mute the one that has the video you should be good.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI don\\'t know how to do anything.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThere you go, beautiful. Can you hear us all right still?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you all so much for joining today. [inaudible 00:06:53] Parent 2, I think we\\'re still getting a little feedback.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m so sorry. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s okay, if there\\'s no video that\\'s okay. The most important thing is just to be able to hear you anyway.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay. There we go. I\\'m so sorry. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSpeaking of technology, that\\'s a very good segue.\\n\\n\\tSo thank you all for taking some time to talk a little bit today about technology and the impact that it\\'s had since the start of the pandemic, we really appreciate all the time you took out to fill out the crisis survey. So this is going to go a little bit more in depth with some of those issues, and really help us understand. So before we get started, maybe we could just go around, introduce ourselves, and maybe just say, the ages of your kids. And then we\\'ll start the discussion. \\n\\n\\tSo my name is Moderator 1, I\\'m a neuropsychologist with the Healthy Brain Network and thanks for joining. Who wants to go next?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi, my name is Parent 3. I have four kids.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi Parent 3.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi. My oldest is 14. I have twin girls, they\\'re 12 and a half, and I have a 5 and a half year old.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, nice. Thank you for joining who wants to go next?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI\\'ll go next. My name is Parent 4. I have a two year old, a 14 year old, a 15 year old and a 17 year old. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so you got a wide spread there. So you\\'ll be able to tell us about different ages. Who\\'s next? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHi, my name is Parent 5 I have a 15 year old and a 12 year old.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, and Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi, my name is Parent 2. I also have four children, most of the others do. So my oldest is 22, he\\'s autistic, on the spectrum. And I have 21 year old, 18 and 15.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, great. So, it\\'s helpful to hear how it\\'s affecting kids of different ages. So, thank you for joining. I think a good way to start would be if you have that with paper and pencil nearby.\\n\\n\\tSo we\\'re thinking of... Oh, hi welcome.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh yes, sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOh no, it\\'s okay we were just getting started. We just finished introductions. Hi, I\\'m Moderator, I\\'m a neuropsychologist with the Healthy Brain Network. And we were just going around saying our names and the ages of your kids. So you can if you don\\'t mind introducing yourself?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAlright, sorry again. My name is Parent 1. I have two children, 10 and 7 year old.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, great. So, what I\\'d like to do now is just take a couple minutes to try to think of positive ways that technology has impacted your kids since the start of the pandemic, and then try to list two or three negative ways that technology has impacted your kids during the pandemic and did you have a paper and pen nearby, just try to jot those down.\\n\\n\\tThank you.\\n\\n\\tAnd then when you\\'re done jotting down a couple of each category, circle the category that you think has had the bigger overall impact. So has the positive impact of technology had a bigger overall impact on your kids since the pandemic or has the negative influence of technology has had a bigger overall impact?\\n\\n\\tOkay, so by a show of hands, who circled the negative group that\\'s having a bigger overall impact?\\n\\n\\tOkay, Parent 5 and Parent 2 and Parent 4 and Corrine.\\n\\n\\tAnd then Parent 3, did you circle the positive group is having the bigger overall impact?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nPositive.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo, let\\'s discuss that a little bit more. But it is interesting to see it. And we\\'ve seen in these groups that there are definitely people who have a lot of overlapping experiences, but then also people are having their own unique experiences. So I think it would be most helpful, definitely to share if you feel you\\'ve had a different experience than someone else is saying, then definitely share that with us. And it will be helpful for us to understand. So the first question that I would like to put out there is talking a little bit about education and the impact that technology has had on the education of your kids. So what if you could speak a little bit about if technology was used for educational purposes before the pandemic? And did you find that beneficial? Did you have any concerns before the pandemic? Since Corona has technology been used for educational purposes? How do you find it beneficial? And have you had any concerns on the technology side of things? Does anyone want to start us off?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'ll go.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, thanks Parent 2.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI feel initially my daughter went to Sea last year and so initially they were used to doing they had online setup, St Joseph by the Sea, and it was going great. And I feel they did a wonderful job and at least the kids were able to continue learning.\\n\\n\\tBut as we came to this year and she transferred to Tottenville, it\\'s honestly ridiculous the way they\\'re doing it because you are either at home or you could do blended. And blended a Tottenville means you go sit in a classroom with your computer, just like you\\'re at home because all the teachers are at home, and the kids are in school. So they sit there with their headsets. I don\\'t know what story is there with teachers, and I love teachers but I\\'m so fed up, they don\\'t want to go back. And they\\'re learning nothing. My daughter... I feel this year has been a complete wash. She was an 85 to 90 student now she barely passes a class, because she just has no motivation. On top of that she had major knee surgery two months ago, which that I guess made it good because she still could do the work, but I don\\'t feel they\\'re really learning anything. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s my, so you felt this year has been [inaudible 00:16:52]?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYes. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nDid her school use technology for educational purposes before the pandemic at all?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSea did, Tottenville had to learn how to do it, which I guess they did between last year for them was a total waste because there were kids who just didn\\'t know what they were doing. This year they know what they\\'re doing. But it\\'s just, number one it\\'s either the teachers keep too long in the class or not long enough. And some of the work is just so ridiculous that they have to do and sometimes it\\'s a lot. And sometimes it\\'s just, I don\\'t know, it\\'s different because they\\'re doing classwork and homework at home. If you\\'re not motivated to start out with it\\'s not quality stuff at all.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, okay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThey need to be in person. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks, Parent 2.\\n\\n\\tCan someone else share what their experience has been with technology for education? \\n\\n\\tYeah, Parent 5. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah. Similarly, to some of the things that Parent 2 said, although we\\'ve had a different experience both my kids had been using collaborative online platforms before the pandemic, which always seemed to be of benefit to the way that it was operating.\\n\\n\\tAnd, obviously there\\'s the benefit that this had to happen in terms of any kind of continuity. But in both cases, I think the meaningfulness of it, or any kind of robust engagement with education has really diminished. My 15 year old had a complete depressive breakdown last year, and including with hospitalizations for depressive incidents, is now at a therapeutic boarding school where at least he\\'s there in person. So we had to have something very dramatic happen through all of that. I think that these things were underlying before but I think the circumstances around a pandemic exacerbated and accelerated this and it was certainly not helped by the pivoting to completely remote. His school, Brooklyn Tech, was just too big I think to be able to handle it meaningfully at all and so that that was a big thing there for us. \\n\\n\\tAnd then my middle schooler, my 12 year old is really struggling, again it makes such a difference when he\\'s able to be in person, his school is now gone to three days in person out of a six day cycle. It hasn\\'t been able to be consistently implemented because of different cases and having to shut down from time to time. But when he\\'s there in person, they\\'re teaching in person, and he\\'s a different kid. And now they hadn\\'t been doing fully asynchronous learning before going to that platform, they had been teaching classes on Zoom. So now, you see those three days, I\\'ll take it because I see what happens when he\\'s there in person. But the asynchronous stuff is really not useful. It\\'s very rote, package assignments that they dial in, it\\'s not engaging and I would agree I think he\\'s regressed over this year.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 5.\\n\\n\\tSomeone else share your experiences technology for education, both before the pandemic, and after any concerns or benefits that you\\'ve seen?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi, I\\'d like to say that for before the pandemic, my older girls the ones that are in middle school, they knew how to work the laptop, they have phones and stuff, but they weren\\'t 100% sure how to use the Google Classrooms and all that the programs for the actual educational material.\\n\\n\\tI was a little bit upset about that, they were depressed and \"oh my god, I\\'m not going to get it done right.\" And they weren\\'t and to my knowledge the teachers weren\\'t even uploading the material correctly. So they weren\\'t getting a lot. They lost out a lot last year in terms of education really, nonetheless, they didn\\'t have in person classroom. We started With just remote, then we did blended learning that was like not really.\\n\\n\\tThe little one lost out most of all, she was in Pre-K. Very tough. I\\'m still working full time. I have to sit by her side while I\\'m working, while I have a call. And it was tough for her because she didn\\'t know how to turn on the laptop, she didn\\'t know how to upload her work, she still doesn\\'t know how to upload her work it\\'s hard to leave that responsibility up to a little kid that\\'s four or five. \\n\\n\\tIn comparison to this year, I can say it\\'s like 70% better than last year because I think that the public education is a lot more prepared than last year in terms of trying to keep up the par with the classes, more on schedule versus links that are broken and not working. They\\'re a little bit more lenient With the kids getting their work in on time, they enable them to do better by giving them small group sessions via Zoom. And that\\'s great because for example all my girls, all four of them, they\\'re fully into going to school in person.\\n\\n\\tAnd I could say the difference between that and before is just in general my kids were like, \"I don\\'t want to go in and what we going to do and they\\'re still zooming.\" [inaudible 00:23:22] But they came home and they were so excited just to see other kids or their teachers and their peers and stuff. So just seeing that made a difference made them want to honestly go back to school in person there are teachers they to tell you, \"hey, why don\\'t you have a pen?\" Or, \"do you need extra help?\" It\\'s better when they\\'re in person, there is a difference.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, so you\\'ve seen the difference in that?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAnd they don\\'t know how to do their own work, upload it, they\\'re using Calendars which is important for day to day personal progression.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo that is a benefit that you\\'ve seen that they\\'ve gained?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nTotally.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, Parent 2 if you don\\'t mind, can you actually... I think the dog is.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI know, I can\\'t figure out how to mute myself.\\n\\n\\tStop barking.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI think you did it before. Just using a phone if you tap somewhere on the screen or swipe from left to right?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNo wait, here I am. I actually am so sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, it\\'s okay. \\n\\n\\tIt happens to the best of us. I think if you just swipe from left to right you should see an option there.\\n\\n\\tOkay. Thank you, Parent 3. Parent 4? Or Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYes, hi. I will start with my youngest he had a really difficult time adjusting as did everyone. But more difficult than my other two kids of a similar age. And he\\'s just returning maybe three weeks ago to a month ago, he\\'s just returning to school. They started out two days Monday and Tuesday and now they just set up to... \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAre you using the computer? [crosstalk 00:25:42] Are you using the computer?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHe was struggling as far as not being able to meet with his other classmates and teachers.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBecause I don\\'t know how to do anything on the tablet.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4, hold on one moment, I\\'m sorry. No, it\\'s okay. So Parent 2, I\\'m sorry, maybe we can actually try to mute you. But I just can\\'t do it because I\\'m not the host, Administrator are you the host of the meeting?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nI am not. Yeah, I\\'m not really sure how to do it either. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI know can do it if you\\'re the host but I don\\'t think we can do it.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nBut, no Parent 2 it sounds a little quieter now. I think as long as maybe if you are just in a space with the door closed and it should be okay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi, yeah she barged right through it. Now I\\'ve found the mute thing.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay great, sorry Parent 4 continue. Your first born just went back recently?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYes, for the full week they just started although this was their first week back last week. I think Wednesday they had a flood so then they didn\\'t finish the week off. So they had to do Zoom classes Thursday and Friday and they\\'re going to go back tomorrow. They\\'re starting a full week so they\\'re going to go back Tuesday.\\n\\n\\tBut it seems like they had a lot of filler rather than content as far as learning and one of the parents at the school had even text in to the other parents saying, \"Do you think that the school seems to be falling off?\" Because of the way they were teaching, I don\\'t know why it went there, but they did a lot of videos more than learning things they were doing videos and dancing and things when you check in to see what they\\'re actually doing at home on the Zoom classes. But he\\'s back now and it seems there\\'s a difference even in what he\\'s learning.\\n\\n\\tBut he was also dealing with I think Zoom burnout because he would tell me, \"I\\'m sick of going on Zoom, I want to go to school, I want to see my teachers, I want to see my friends.\" And so it hit him very, very hard. My daughter, she\\'s 15 she was in a gifted program and she was just really let down and saying that she worked so hard and now everything she worked for was kind of just falling through, she felt. And she\\'s also just resuming going to school she goes three days out of the week. And it seems to have a better impact on her actually being there because she was in the house and she\\'s home and doing Zoom. She does the Zoom but then once Zoom is over, all three of them they all just want to be in their rooms. They don\\'t want to come out. I have to try to engage them and take them places and do things with them so that they will come out of their rooms. They just want to be in the room.\\n\\n\\tAnd my 17 year old, he I would say was doing better with the Zoom at home than at school because, I don\\'t know, he just had issues of attending all his classes. But I still have to be on him at home because even though he\\'s at home, and he\\'s right there sitting at the desk, there are times when he can find other things to do on the computer and not be in the class and he\\'s telling me he\\'s in the classes and I\\'m checking, \"I\\'m there, I\\'m there.\" And then teachers are calling me telling me, \"Oh, he\\'s not in the class.\" So it\\'s been kind of a struggle but he\\'s doing better than he was physically at school.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHow is he doing better, academically or just?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAcademically, he\\'s doing the work, his grades are better.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so it seems like it\\'s still a challenge but academically it\\'s been better?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 1, what was your experience with technology for education before the pandemic and how has that changed and concern, benefits?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWell again I have two children one is 10 and the other one is seven. So 5th grade and 1st grade. So first off my older one didn\\'t really use the computer that often before the pandemic but he likes using technology. So somehow he was happy when it did happen, going remote, and the one thing I like and again my son, the older one has an IEP, he helped me out.\\n\\n\\tSo to have a better idea about what was being done at school and how he was doing it. So I was more on top in being a to assist him. The draw back is that sometimes the teachers would make comments and tell him you didn\\'t do this right but there was no follow up because one teacher was teaching remotely, the other one was doing in person. So I would say it did affect him because he was not getting the support he used to. So finally when they were able to go to blended learning he was fine with it but when he, two or three weeks ago, had to go full day, five days a week, he wanted to go fully remote because I think that he\\'s started to be challenged. He has a hard time with writing so he felt overwhelmed and that\\'s why he wanted to back off a little bit and go fully remote because he thought it was easier.\\n\\n\\tAnd my younger one, again I had to be next to him to connect him to all the meetings and printing the documents and so he had a lack of motivation somehow. I mean he would listen to his classes but getting him to do the work, the assignments, was sometimes challenging. And it\\'s the same this week he started going back five days and it\\'s hard to get him in, he became a homey person.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so that actually is a good transition into my next question. So now that it sounds like people are starting to go back and things are returning to be more in person. What parts of the technology use would you hope would continue or is there anything that you would hope would continue? And what parts Would you like to see go? And also what challenges do you anticipate facing as your kids go back? Anyone can start us off.\\n\\n\\tYeah, Parent 5.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI would say I would love to see most of these tools go out the window for a while as we go back. I\\'d really love to be able to see them start to work collaboratively and engage as people in person. Obviously we will still have those supports of the technology but I hope that we can start to use it as support tools and not the over-reliance on them that we\\'ve had. And I understand that I said the other day to be able to have something that is more functional and he was saying and the rote stuff. \\n\\n\\tWhile some of the others were talking I think the thing for my 12 year old he\\'s happier when he\\'s there in person, but to move from that but shift it\\'s so easy for him to now just slump all day long. And because it\\'s all on the one platform or the one tool and when I\\'m working all day long and can\\'t be checking up on him rather than going down and doing the same thing. It all just become this one little suck and it is very easy for him to be distracted and to switch to surfing the internet, or watching a video, or playing a game. So, I would just really to be able to move to actual instruction.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo eventually it sounds you could see it being helpful as a supplement but at the core, it seems they he really needs it in person and that you think a challenge of going back is going to be that he\\'s gotten used to kind of, like you said, slumping.\\n\\n\\tAnyone else about thinking about going back any challenges you anticipate? Anything you\\'d to see stay or go?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI think I would to see technologies stay and if it will be mandatory, it should be blended. Technology should always be there as a part of the world and the way we move each day, and it should be mandatory and implemented within the school system and they should learn how to use it day one when they go in. They should know how to turn on the laptop or upload something, the key things, the main stuff, which they weren\\'t taught. They should have enacted force and I don\\'t think they did. So they use these things and they don\\'t know how and they don\\'t fully know how to do everything.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. Did the school give any explicit instruction, about how to use even over the past year and a half?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNo, it was here you go, this is it. Maybe they sent a video. I don\\'t know, something.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, so the skills that they picked out they just picked up on their own?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. I see. Anyone else, challenges you anticipate in going back or parts of technologies you\\'d like to see stay or go?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'ll talk, I had to go sit in the bathroom because it\\'s too loud.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you Parent 2 for trying to make this work. I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nNo, I\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, it\\'s okay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI guess I anticipate a lot of anxiety, my daughter she struggles with anxiety. Parent 2, Child 1 is my youngest. That\\'s what I\\'m talking because everybody else seems to have younger kids. So she is already getting so nervous about having to go back. Meanwhile, she\\'s not doing what she used to do because she said it almost becomes you feel schoolwork is optional. I mean because she\\'s on the older end so it obviously is different than with the little ones and she\\'s really getting so nervous. And she\\'s dying to go back because she rarely sees any friends or I do believe all the kids from the younger ages they should start teaching, they should have the technology because that was the good thing about Sea is that they had a program, because they didn\\'t do snow-days. So they had it totally set up so it was not such a big deal going remote. \\n\\n\\tBut even with my other children my 18 year old started he graduated in last June so he started CSI and he ended up dropping out. He did first semester he did okay he struggles with anxiety a bit too and OCD, so I had talks with him, \"you can\\'t drop out\" because now he withdrew too late that we have to pay now for the semester that he didn\\'t do but he just couldn\\'t do it, he was going nuts. My other son, thank God he goes to a Dayhab where it\\'s very small so he\\'s still going. \\n\\n\\tAnd my other daughter she goes to Dalton. She\\'s in her third year. She\\'s very smart but she\\'s neurotic, her grades are so good it\\'s ridiculous. So good, and she\\'s still doing very well, but she doesn\\'t like it either. Right now she does two labs in person so it\\'s two classes a week. I don\\'t know, but naturally she\\'s going out now a bit there and socially. I don\\'t even know there\\'s just so many, this whole thing has just been very not good all around. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t help anyone, I know we have to worry about the getting but... we all actually had the virus in January. But anyway.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo a lot of different challenges I hear from like from each kid and then even though they want to go back does there\\'s slight anxiety there at times.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, it\\'s been so long. Next year she\\'ll be a Junior, Parent 2, Child 1, and she\\'s never ever been in the school. I mean she\\'s been there with my other children but she\\'s never been taught in that school. So, she\\'s anxious about that too.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, yeah it\\'s like the first day of school, but like worst because it\\'s not just two months off. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, exactly.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So, any other thoughts that we haven\\'t mentioned yet about challenges you anticipate in going back or anything that you\\'d like to see stay or go?\\n\\n\\tOkay, so we can move on to the next part of the discussion so for the rest of the time, I\\'d like to shift the conversation to talking about media and the impact that media and TV consumption has had on your kids. So first question is, can you talk a little bit about how your kids used media and TV before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before? Was it beneficial before? And now during the pandemic, how are your kids using media and TV and do you have any concerns or have you seen any benefits from media and TV?\\n\\n\\tAnyone can start us off.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nLike I say my kids before the pandemic, didn\\'t really watch TV or any news or anything like that.\\n\\n\\tA lot of the times they will watch Netflix, or they go on social media or like this TikTok thing and stuff like that. So whatever they hear is from on there, or from friends, and group chats. Other than that, they don\\'t really watch the news so they don\\'t really know of what\\'s going on there unless there\\'s a discussion about it within the house or they hear something from the social media. For really they\\'re just singing and dancing so I can\\'t say that it\\'s really affecting them in that way, they just know that they\\'re in the house and not really going anywhere because of this pandemic, that\\'s all they know.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, you haven\\'t seen it necessarily have like a negative overall impact on them like media and TV?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNo, I can\\'t say that it has.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Just like something they do for fun because they really can\\'t do much else?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Anyone else? Yeah, Parent 4.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI would say my kids are they watch TV, a little more than they did before. My youngest son, he was more a outdoors person, and now he\\'s just like, I have to tell him you can\\'t watch TV so that he isn\\'t on there 24/7, because he would be if he if you didn\\'t tell him. He\\'s on YouTube and videos, anything he could go 24/7 just in front of the TV.\\n\\n\\tMy oldest son 17 year old. He has set up video games on each floor, in his bedroom, in the attic and on the first floor. Just so that he can have, if his brother is in the room with him then he\\'ll go downstairs and hook up with the video game. He just has it set up so that he can be on any video games, almost like 24/7 if not that videos. My daughter she\\'s in her room on her TV, and I don\\'t know they have some kind of way they have video games on the TV where she\\'s here and they\\'re jumping around Dance Revolution-ing. But she\\'s more into the news so she will come and tell me, \"Mom, did you hear this?\" I mean she\\'s always engaged in what\\'s going on. She will come and tell me that but I think they\\'re just a little bit too much into the TV since they\\'ve been shut in. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so it\\'s gotten to be where it\\'s just a lot of their time is spent on that? \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah, too much, too much. I have to get them to do things so that they\\'re not around the clock on it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\n\\tSo I\\'m curious about your daughter, you said that she\\'s become like more aware of these things. Do you find that to be a positive thing or is it something that...\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt\\'s a positive thing it\\'s not really overwhelming. It\\'s not overwhelming or depressing her or anything but she just lets me know that she knows what\\'s going on asking me do I know, constantly updated.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay thanks Parent 4. Anyone else about your children\\'s needs by consumption media? Yeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes, we don\\'t have cable but we have access to like Netflix, HBO.\\n\\n\\tAgain what I was controlling before the pandemic was more their screen time. And what my older one, the 10 year old, does is more like Minecraft and their group chat was just with their friends and again I went from controlling one hour a day to now it\\'s unlimited time. Because he has a harder time entertaining himself and then with a few parents, we were like okay they\\'re playing Minecraft which is not too bad, it\\'s not our favorite but it was constructive, and they were between their friends. But sometimes he goes out of control and it started to be the main focus of my son\\'s life. If he wakes up he would just go to his computer so I tried to give him more freedom but at the same time I realized that it has to have its limits.\\n\\n\\tAnd my younger one who\\'s seven, somehow he\\'s not watching too much TV but he I noticed that he went from educational program to now any type of cartoons. But I would say depends on the personality but he entertains himself more like he\\'s more crafty and I realize sometimes he will point out that his brother is too much on the screen, and the reason why I gave a bit limited time is because it was creating a lot of struggles in the house and I think we all have enough stress around us.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:47:21]\\n\\n\\tNo, no. Sorry, sorry thank you. Yeah.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThank you. Yeah we also have had real issues with the time where we had been able to exercise certain amount of discipline on screen time before and it just go thrown out the window.\\n\\n\\tCertainly when my 15 year old, last year it became the whole night and day got completely switched. She was spending a lot of time, like either chatting online all night or watching movies or YouTube videos, stuff like that and that got things pretty out of whack. That obviously is being addressed because he\\'s in an environment now where he doesn\\'t have access to that. \\n\\n\\tAnd with the 12 year old, like still it\\'s a struggle because he uses an iPad for school and he\\'s always trying to switch off to watch a video. Sometimes he\\'s playing the Nintendo Switch while he\\'s watching a video, both things while he\\'s supposed to be in school. Constantly having to go in and monitor that and take things away but during the day, I kept moving the switch out of the way that\\'s what he\\'s got. And a little bit of social media, I think with Minecraft and with friends, that\\'s been a lot of the only way he\\'s kept engaged with people that he knows, his friends and they\\'re chatting that way on their Minecraft or some other video game.\\n\\n\\tAnd both kids I don\\'t think they consume in terms of TV per se, like again we have Netflix and stuff and NPR is always on in the background so I think they seem to be akin to what\\'s happening in the world around. And surprisingly, sometimes I feel like 12 year old is maybe more aware of it than I think, he does ask questions about it. School seems to be pretty good at keeping discussions going on with current events. So, keep that I guess. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so similar to Parent 1 you\\'ve seen an increase in the amount of time and having to like hold back on some of the controls.\\n\\n\\tOkay, anyone else thoughts about media? Media before? Media since the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI would say, social media and my kids they\\'re all older and everybody has their phone, their computer, they did that. I do think that definitely watching more TV, but once again like Netflix, things like that and actually with my daughters it\\'s been kind of nice because we went on binge fests of Supernatural and all these other kind of shows. So we spend more time together and have something to talk about that relates to use all.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s really nice to know.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBut that is something that I think, I don\\'t know if it\\'s Parent 5 had said about, the online and stuff my 18 year old son last year... because I think she\\'s the one who had to go to the boarding school, whoever that was, my son who was watching these videos that he began to think he was cursed from watching these videos. And we were very close to having to send him somewhere because it\\'s almost like he became suicidal, he became so obsessed, he couldn\\'t eat, drink, sleep, about being cursed by, he saw like these doll things, I don\\'t even know what it was but it was something. He\\'s always had issues but it really, so then he wasn\\'t allowed to go on the computer, do any of that stuff but he\\'s crazy with the video games, he plays mostly basketball and stuff which I guess is, better. But anyway that\\'s my story.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, so it sounds like it really impacted him and you had to just pull it back?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative).\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Okay, and then. So I guess most of you have touched on this already but as we\\'re going back to being more in person and things returning to be somewhat normal. What changes would you like to see in media and TV use in your kids? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI\\'d like us to be able to exercise more balance really. I feel like I\\'m half the time I\\'m shouting into the wind over it so to work with him particularly to have healthier balance.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWell for us now I mean only because now the weather\\'s getting nicer I don\\'t have the issue with them watching as much, TV or whether they\\'re playing videos or watching TV and stuff. Because the weather is nicer, they\\'re more active. Three of the girls are closer in age and they hang out together, they\\'ll go bike riding, we have a pool they\\'ll go swimming. They\\'ll interact with each other where they\\'re not watching the TV and they don\\'t want to know what\\'s going on because they\\'re just together around each other, and they\\'re still younger, they\\'re not wanting to go out and party and all this and that. Well, I don\\'t have that issue yet.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, and that\\'s nice that they have like somebody built in to play with at home so they\\'re not on as much.\\n\\n\\tOkay, any other last thoughts?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI mean I would say the same with the Summer coming we did our yard last year, we have a nice big pool. Last Summer was really nice with that and the kids, so they\\'re looking forward to that and definitely the rebalancing of time indoors versus outdoors so it\\'ll be, I think good. We\\'re looking forward to it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo, hopefully, the balancing. Yeah. Any other thoughts?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI\\'ll just say, I just think the weather definitely has an impact. We had the first warm day and I mean it was really nice that day my son got up.\\n\\n\\tHe\\'s the outdoor guy. He got up he got on the scooter, he left and went around the block, on his scooter, masked up and went around the block and came back home. That following day, it was cold so I just assume that he thought that it was gonna be beautiful that day he went out in his t-shirt. I mean he actually went around the block thinking I guess, \"it\\'s going to be nice so I\\'ll go a little farther.\" But he came back and he was freezing because he just can\\'t wait to get out because we\\'ve been chatting for so long now. But I think a weather will definitely have impact on everybody because they want they all want to be outside.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy oldest son he goes out and walks around the block every day. He takes the two year old that\\'s on his back, he just has to get out he just can\\'t stay inside. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, I think you\\'re right and we\\'ve all been confused about what to wear these days but I think we\\'re all just [inaudible 00:55:26] so once we had the first few nice days we\\'re ready to come into it. \\n\\n\\tAll right, I think you guys gave us a ton of really good insight and good information and so we really appreciate you all sharing your experiences and it really helps us understand a little bit more in depth how technology has been impacting everyone. And Administrator maybe to talk a little bit about the town hall.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSorry that I am muted. Yeah, so just thank you guys so much for participating today, about of the things that you guys have shared like Moderator 1 mentioned earlier, we\\'re definitely seeing commonalities like just in what our families are experiencing so thank you so much for the information that you gave us today. Just compiling all of this information that we\\'re having from like all these different focus groups just to be able to give you guys that information during the town hall meeting which we\\'re planning to have end of May, early June. So once that\\'s like finalized and everything we\\'ll definitely let you guys know so that we are able to also like hear about those experiences and things like that.\\n\\n\\tIn regards to compensation, you guys should receive it no later than Wednesday, as soon as we wrap up today I\\'m going to give our administrator your information and you should expect to receive it via email. If you don\\'t receive it by Wednesday you can definitely reach out to me, either by email or through my number, and just let me know and when we can work on that. Thank you so much for your cooperation today and all the information that you gave us.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you everyone have a great rest of the afternoon.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHave a good day.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:57:52]'b\"Parent 1:\\n\\n(silence) You see?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[inaudible 00:00:41] No, make sure ... I'm going to hide, ugly. Turn it off. How I know I'm in the right place?\\n\\nParent 1, Child 1:\\n\\nI don't know. You're on call. I'm guessing ...\\n\\nParent 1: \\n\\nI'm recording. [inaudible 00:00:57] Hello.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHello?\\n\\nParent 1: \\n\\nAm I in the right meeting?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThis is for Child Mind Institute?\\n\\nParent 1: \\n\\nYes, but I can't see you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWait, don't ... \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi. [crosstalk 00:01:12]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHow are you?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay. Is it only me?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI don't know. Are you a parent?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI'm a parent, too.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThis is weird.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI guess [crosstalk 00:01:36].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay, so we'll wait. I'll put this here. Where can I put this?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n Hi, Parent 1, Child 1 and Parent 2.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHi.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks for joining. [crosstalk 00:02:12] We're going to wait for a few more people to join and hopefully get started in a few minutes.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIn the meantime, if you have a paper and pencil nearby, it would be helpful for the beginning.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHi, this is Parent 3.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi. Parent 3 you said?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYes. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, welcome and we're back [crosstalk 00:02:41] the house. We're waiting for a couple more people to join but hopefully we'll start in a few minutes.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nAll right, good. (silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHey, [Administrator 00:04:10].\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHey.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI told everyone we're just going to wait another couple minutes to see who comes in.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nGot it. For those of you guys who are in the Zoom now who didn't get the chance to complete the consent form, I just sent in the ... Sorry, my brain just went pfft. But I just sent the link to the consent form so that you're able to do it right now. (silence)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAdministrator, what do you think, should we get started or wait another couple of minutes?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nOne, two, three, three, four, five. I can quickly reach out to the other parents and see what's going on. So maybe by like 3:36.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right, great. I'll start just some introductions but Parent 2, Parent 1, Child 1. And sorry, your name is not there, you said Parent 3 or ...\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nParent 3. My name is not there, yeah, it's not there. [crosstalk 00:07:41]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo thank you guys so much for joining us today. This is really helpful for our research to just really understand a little bit deeper about how technology has impacted people during the pandemic. And it was really helpful that you filled out the crisis surveys, but this will hopefully give us a little bit more like additional information to understand. So how about we just start by introducing ourselves and maybe everyone can just say how old your kids are. So my name is Moderator 1, I'm a neuropsychologist with the Healthy Brain Network. So Parent 1, Child 1, do you want to introduce yourself?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy name is Parent 1, and my daughter is 17, her name is Parent 1, Child 1.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, so that's why it says Parent 1, Child 1. So hi, Parent 1. And your daughter is 17. Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMy name is Parent 2, and my son is 10, the one that I'm speaking of today.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Great. And Parent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nMy son is 15.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n15, okay, so we have some different ages which is good. So the first thing that [crosstalk 00:09:19]. I think Administrator is calling them now, but we can start with this in the meantime. So the first thing that would be helpful to do is let's take a couple of minutes and if you can just jot down a couple of positive ways that technology has impacted your child ... [crosstalk 00:09:40] your children over the course of the pandemic and then also a couple of negative ways that technology has your children over the course of the pandemic. (silence) Once you have a list jotted down, try to think which group has had the overall big impact on your child.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSay that again? [crosstalk 00:11:17] You cut off, say it again.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry, so once you have a couple jotted down in each category, try to think which category has had the biggest overall impact on your child. So has the positive impacts, is that the one that stands out more when you look at the overall effect or the negative impacts, has that been more prominent? Just circle one group? (silence) Okay, so now, if you could just by a show of hands tell me if you circled the negative group as having the bigger overall impact on your children. So Parent 2, you said the negative group?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nNegative group, right.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 1, also the negative group. Okay, Parent 3, would you say the negative or the positive had the bigger ...\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNegative. [crosstalk 00:13:03]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, all right, let's definitely discuss that. One thing I just like to emphasize before we get into this is that we've definitely seen that a lot of people have been reporting common experiences to us, but then you know a lot of people also have been reporting that their experience is unique in different ways, so please feel free to chime in. If you have something different than somebody is saying, that's really important for us to hear.\\n\\n\\tSo the first topic I'd like to put out there is if you could share what your child ... So first I would like to talk a bit about the impacts that technology has had on your child's educational experience specifically. So thinking about how was technology used for your child's education before the [crosstalk 00:14:04] pandemic and did you consider it to be useful before the pandemic, was it a non factor, was it something you were concerned about. And then thinking about once the pandemic started, how was technology used for their education and what were the benefits, what were the concerns. So before we get to answering that question, I'd want to just welcome. So hi, I see that you just joined.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi, how are you?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWhat's your name?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nParent 4\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHi, Parent 4, welcome. I'm Moderator 1. I'm a neuropsychologist with the Healthy Brain Network. And so, so far, all we did was introductions and we are just putting out our first discussion question now. So the first question is just thinking about how was technology used for educational purposes for your kids before the pandemic, how did that change during the pandemic, and what were your concerns before and during, or what were the benefits before and during? So does anyone want to start us off? Parent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYes. So for me, they were a very big distraction before the pandemic, and it's a far worse distraction now to the point that I feel, and I've shared this with other parents, that kids can easily switch from one screen to the other and they're easily distracted. And unless you're there behind them, they can be on Instagram and whatnot all day basically. And because they hear the teacher speak, they know when to switch back. So I think the distraction was always there but they were not distracted in class so to speak, unless they were allowed to use their phones, which they don't, unless they cheat but it's been not good. I think the distraction has been detrimental to their learning this whole year. So yes, it's a great resource, they can learn anything, they can find anything. But if they don't have the maturity to say no, I'm not going to be browsing the internet while I'm supposed to be in class, it's useless to have them ... Just not good.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt sounds like you had concerns before. Your concerns definitely became greater. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou feel like they haven't been able to really harness it because it's just been a distraction.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nVery much.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, can anyone else share what their experiences were with technology for education before and during? Parent 4, you want to share?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSo [inaudible 00:17:04].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry, we actually can't hear you, Parent 4. Yeah. The audio is cutting out. You're not on mute but it's just breaking up. That's weird. Do you want to try shutting off your video and speaking? Sometimes that helps. Now you're on mute. Try saying something.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nCan you hear me now?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYes, we can actually.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOkay, great. So I have three children. Two go to charter schools and one is in Catholic high school. And I think a big part of how each of them have responded to the technology aspect has a lot to do with the structure of the school. So my son who's in Monsignor Farrell who, he is the one who completed the Healthy Brain Network assessment, his school makes you stay on video, in uniform, they take attendance every class, they continue to watch you and see what you're doing and comment the same way they would as if you were in school. So if you are dosing off, if you're not looking at the camera, if it looks like you're looking down in your lap, they'll say something to you to address it.\\n\\n\\tMy other two who are in charter schools, you might as well teaching to a bowl of jello because they are 100% having conversations on every social media platform, playing Roblox, planning the rest of their day. So I agree but I do think so my experience has been a mixed one, but I think that there is way for technology to be helpful when you have to as long as you have ... \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4, sorry, you cut out there again but it seems like you're saying that you had a similar experience but it really depends on the school, that it can be if there is proper structure with the school then you found that it could really be beneficial but there needs to be a proper structures in place. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:19:34] Thanks, Parent 4. Okay, Parent 2 or Parent 1?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:19:43] Yeah, I have a 10-year-old who has an IEP and unfortunately, a lot of his needs aren't being met through the computer. They're trying but he has OT and he spends more time screaming and crying that he can't do it with her as opposed to actually getting the [inaudible 00:20:08] twice a week. They're now in person, five days a week so that is has been huge. They're more held accountable at school, they can't take their phone out. So at home, I mean, I'm working from home, I have three kids at home, screaming at them all day to get on their computer, make sure you're doing your work, it doesn't work. And the private schools are working way better than public schools, absolutely like 100%.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you have friends that are in private schools who have said they are having better experiences?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYes, I have neighbors that are in private schools and I'm a DOE employee and it is horrible.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you see it from the inside kind of also?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo okay, what do you think is better in the private schools? Is it that they're getting ... [crosstalk 00:21:10]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThe fact that the kids are going to school, there is not really a lot of remote teaching, they're actually in-person teaching and they have separate remote teachers for the remote kids. So the in-person kids are actually learning. Like I said, my two boys now are in person. They are learning and the teachers are there which is good and they're really getting something out of it, but it's only been for maybe the last month. So one month doesn't make up for a whole [inaudible 00:21:42].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. So Parent 1, what were your experiences with using technology for education before the pandemic, how has that changed and what concerns [crosstalk 00:21:55] have you seen?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWe broke it down within the positive and negative aspect but my daughter also has an IEP and I find that I, myself am struggling because I'm working from home as well and my daughter has ADHD. It's impossible for me to sit here from 9:00 to 5:00 and look at this screen and I'm continuously getting up. So she sits there from 8:00 a.m. literally to extra, extra help to 5:00 or 6:00. I'm sorry but it's impossible to sit all day here just looking at a screen. And it's not the same interaction. And I think teachers don't have a lot of patience. They're overwhelmed as well. Like I said, I have to keep reinforcing, telling her continue, what are you doing? And it's just a lot of me as far as I'm also working as well and I have another one that's learning downstairs, so it's a struggle but it hasn't been the same. And she's struggling in one subject which she wasn't before so it's hard.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWhich subject is that, that she's struggling in now?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBiology.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nShe was doing well before and like I said, it's just constantly there's no way you can sit here from 8:00 a.m. because I can't [crosstalk 00:23:04] just looking at a screen. [crosstalk 00:23:08]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAre you noticing that it's more of a problem for your child with ADHD than the other kids?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah, most definitely because she's distracted a lot. Every 15 minutes, you have to keep, Parent 1, Child 1 continue, keep it moving, what are you doing? All day long. So with me, it's constant oversight. I feel like she's losing out because she's not getting the same interaction that she had when she was in school, she's not getting the services that [crosstalk 00:23:35]. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMy son's IEP, he has ADHD as well and on his IEP, he's got constant prompts. I can't prompt him every 15 minutes when he's distracted, I have a job. This remote thing does not work.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIt's not working. [crosstalk 00:23:54]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nConstant prompts are probably not something that they can do over the ... \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThey're not reaching their full potential. And my daughter [crosstalk 00:24:05]. My daughter is very athletic, and not doing the sports is affecting her immensely.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nJust the not having the extra curricular activities is [crosstalk 00:24:12]?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSorry, Parent 2, what were you saying?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThe sports coming back has been a tremendous help because I mean now at least my boys see that if they don't participate more at school and focus more, then the sports don't happen. I use it as leverage, thank, god. Because god knows we can't use the computer as leverage. They need it for work and then they go on side track and go on their stuff. Yeah, they can't prompt the kid on the Zoom meet or the Google Classroom because if they prompt him then they're calling out on the kid and then that's like now they're picking on them so that's a problem, too.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIt's a catch 22 for teachers right now. It's really ... [crosstalk 00:24:56] \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIt's hard for them, too, so.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. So the next question is as we look towards hopefully complete return in person to in-person instruction, what parts of using technology for education would you like to see stay and what parts would you like to do away with?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nEvery time my daughter has a term paper or something to do, I mean in my mind, it's like cheating just googling stuff. I like the way I went to school, I had to actually read a book, I actually had to do research. So I find that frustrating, I don't think that, that's really mentally helping her to get to the next level when it's just googling everything and then now, these kids know how to get to websites and get a term paper written for them. It's a lot of cheating going on. It's a lot of cheating, that's another one. But all these tests, there's a lot of room for kids. There is a lot of room [crosstalk 00:25:57].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo Parent 1, was that a concern that you had before the pandemic or is it something that?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:26:03]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBut now, like I said, now that she's home, she's doing shortcuts. And then I see her, ask her what's the meaning of a word, she'll google it really quickly on her phone, really quickly. It's like they're not getting the full aspect, they're just trying to get it over with.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, so you're noticing shortcuts.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThey have too much speed and too much flexibility. [crosstalk 00:26:25]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI'm also finding that they know the computer better than we know the computer.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWe work with a program called i-Ready, and we were just informed, one of the kids showed us how he can go into the program and change his grades.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWow. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, fifth grade, go in and change his grades.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo it's hard to regulate something when they're one step ahead you then.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo Parent 3, what were going to say, what would you hope to see stay or go?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI would like to also see things go back to not before but to the way we used to do things. We used to pick up a book and a notebook. [crosstalk 00:27:12] We used to underline things and then jot down notes and read. And all this technology, all they need ... My son is all day, Alexa this, Alexa that. There you go. [crosstalk 00:27:31] Now Alexa's talking. Alexa stop.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat was great. Exhibit A.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, so I want to see a notebook, I want to see [crosstalk 00:27:45], a book, a physical book, things like that, a map or something.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nBack to the basics and you're noticing shortcuts also. Parent 4, from the technology that we've seen being used for education, are there any parts you'd like to see stay or any parts you'd like to see go?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSo I think that for as much as we're used to pen, paper, reading a book, having to really read and learn things and memorize things, I don't think that we're going to be, our world is going to require our children to ever go backwards. So one of the things one of the schools that my kids go to on day one, he shared with us that because the world is the way it is and technology is at our fingertips, they were not going to require that our children memorize anything that they could Google or look up quickly, that they were going to place the value on how do we get them to really understand what the meaning of those things are.\\n\\n\\tSo you can Google that Christopher Columbus sailed in 1492 which we had to painstakingly remember. But now, they're going to have you really think about why did he do that, what was the significance of it. So I do feel that there's something to be said for the fact that they can navigate the internet the way that they do, it does put more onus on us as parents to really make sure that they're on the appropriate sites. But I'm okay with a lot of this technology a long as the teachers are eliciting from them an understanding of what it is that they're looking up and writing down and not just that they're doing it blindly.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, that's an interesting point, Parent 4. So it's kind of like what you were saying before that with the right structure, it can be harnessed and that you see it as kind of preparing them for the future and if the basics can be looked up easily then they can move on to some higher order thinking, so that's an interesting perspective.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI wanted to add something. [crosstalk 00:30:14] I think my son has told me that certain websites are blocked from schools laptops and computers. So while they're there and they are supposed to be using the computer for schoolwork, they have that restriction that they can't go on Facebook or Instagram so something that here they can do, so they can't do that in school so there was certain some sort of restriction in school which I don't restrict the computer here.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, so that could be something that if the computer does have those restrictions on it and if there's a way where things can be blocked that [crosstalk 00:30:55].\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, anyone have anything else to add to parts of technology you'd like to see stay or go?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThe thing is, as far as technology advancing, that's understood but in the real world, when you take an exam or you take any type of certifications, you can't Google at the test site so you didn't memorize anything, googling at that point is completely useless. So some things you have to absorb and some things you have to learn. When I'm in my job, my supervisor asks me for certain things, I can't just Google right there, I have to have the knowledge.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat's interesting, you need study skills also you're saying. That you need to be able to actually study and there are a lot of jobs that require you to have certain knowledge. Okay, so the next question I wanted to move on to is as we are returning more in person, what challenges do you anticipate for your children in transitioning back to school?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBeing behind. I feel like this whole year is a big blur.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo being behind academically?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAcademically, yeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 3, you have a [crosstalk 00:32:13]?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYes, my son is starting 11th grade this year in September. This is the year when they start to discuss college, when they fill out their forms, and they visit colleges. I don't see him or us ready in any way to do this at all. I mean I'm not looking forward to September. I don't even think that they are prepared with the knowledge because they need to take their exams and all of that. It's going to be awful, I'm not very confident about what they have learned this year and last year.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, you feel like they're a step behind.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNot going to be prepared for college guaranteed. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:33:01] They got to write essays, they got to be prepared.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 2, yes?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI know when my boys went back full time, I had trouble with my older one crying, can I stay home, I don't want to go back to school. So I mean, it was a lot but I wouldn't keep him home because I just knew it was just the fact that you've been home for so long and he just didn't want to go in.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nHow long would you say it took him to adjust to go back?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMaybe the first two weeks, I was still getting please can I stay home, please don't make me go to school, nobody's there, there's only 10 of us. I don't care if you're the only one, you go and have a great day. See you later. [crosstalk 00:33:44]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThere was ...\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThere was a lot of resistance. I mean there was a little bit from the 10-year-old, but once he got to school, he was fine and he never, he once or twice, they're up early at 6:30 so it's an early day for them but once he got in, he was fine. The older one, just like it was easier to stay home and not do your work and you're being held accountable at school, whereas at home, I can only hold you accountable when the emails come in that you're missing all the work. Or that evening at 11:00 when I'm actually able to check it for you and scream like a maniac, you're missing all this work, you didn't do anything today. But you sat behind a computer and basically I guess you're on games or other things. I mean like I said, working parents really got hit hard with this.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Parent 4, any challenges you anticipate as things started to go back?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI think my son, interestingly enough, my younger two, I think they can't get to school fast enough and that will be in their best interest. My oldest, I think actually has done better, I mean partially because the school has done a really nice job of how they structured it. But I think the social aspect sort of distracted him a lot, and he felt different than everybody, and I think now having the opportunity to do this from home has made him less anxious about everything else and able to then focus more on the work. So I've seen him do better than he has in the past. Now, it could coincide with the fact that he also started taking Vyvanse but I do worry about how he'll feel. And we're moving, so now he's going to start a new school in a new city and be back in school full time.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWow, so it seems like he was doing well without the social pressure and all the distractions that come with social drama, but he's going to be starting in a new school so that might be a challenge.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. So let's actually shift the conversation now away from the educational use of technology and talk a little bit about gaming and how just playing games online has impacted your children. So if you guys could share how did your child use gaming before the pandemic, was it something that you had concerns about, and how did that change over the course of the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can relate because she's a girl. [crosstalk 00:36:38] She's looking at social media, taking cute pictures, how cute she is, that's all she does. [crosstalk 00:36:45]\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi, so you can also talk about your child's social media use. That might be more so like a better focus just based on how you guys answered for the survey so [crosstalk 00:37:02]. No problem. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNow, I just saw that. I asked the wrong question.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIt's okay. So Parent 1, I would definitely love to know about Parent 1, Child 1's social media use before the pandemic and then how has it been now and then everybody else. Even if it's not actual social media sites, if it's using PlayStation and communicating through that way because that's [inaudible 00:37:29] the best ways in which you guys can answer that.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI would say during the pandemic, it started out as an outlet, an entertainment, a way to escape somewhat but now, it's just like a hardcore addiction. She does not let that phone go for one second, not even for the bathroom, I've never seen such dependence on that phone which I call the antichrist because I myself limit my time on the computer. I just find it horrible because now it's just more part of her life and it's too much and I can't stop it, she's older now.\\n\\n\\tBut it's really bad because I think she's not even socializing. It's just constantly on the phone, but my daughter focuses on that a lot because of her other issues that she has with socializing so she does it more so on the phone. But I find it very negatively impacting her socialization skills, her academic skills, her verbal skills. Just not communicating because now they text and they're doing all the slang and they're not really communicating like they used to. So I just think it's been negatively impacting on her. And all the fights in our house is because of the iPhone. I hate it, I hate it and there's not much I can do about it because she's already older.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, so Parent 1, it's kind of like the amount of time that she's spending on it and then also it sounds like also some of the quality of her communication like just talking more in slang or ... [crosstalk 00:38:57]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI can only text her, that's the only way. She's downstairs and we only text, that's the only way to communicate. It's no communication. But I consider it for her like her heart, this is like a liver to her. It's always attached to her. And I think it's a sad situation of what we're getting our kids into and I take responsibility, yes, I do, but because my daughter has special needs, she's sharing a pad as well, she wears a couple of implants so focusing, texting, that's how it started with the main communication because that's her whole context of communicating more so. But now, it's a sad world what we're going to with these [inaudible 00:39:36]. I'm sorry, it's just a sad reality and I hate it.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI'm not even on social media. No one believes me. I am not. I just shop a little bit, I swear to you. I make sure I said no, it's a beautiful day, it's sunny outside, I think it's negative for me to be on the phone. It just makes no sense. All my friends do not want to talk to me because they do not believe I'm not on Facebook, I'm not on TikTok. I got to go to the park to walk my dog, get some air, go shopping. The phone, I hate it. It's bad.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo even in your generation, you see that it is point of contention but then I imagine even more so for your child's generation that it's like you said, it seems like it's an organ. Anyone else, tell us a little bit about social media use before [crosstalk 00:40:26] how that changed and any concerns.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nMy son is a boy so there's definitely more gaming. Yes, there was a lot of gaming before the pandemic and there was a lot more to the point that we found him in bed in the middle of the night with a laptop or with a phone playing with friends. So we had to remove all devices for several months, they had to be removed. Only a little laptop for school use. The gaming, it's been a huge distraction and the source of a lot of conflict and had to be physically, literally removed. It was a huge distraction.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, and was that a challenge or a concern before the pandemic, the gaming or ...\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nIt was but it got worse because we would go to sleep and because he didn't have to wake up at 6:30 in the morning anymore. All he needed to do was wake up 10 minutes before school starts, so he could spend more time playing. And we weren't really noticing that this was happening, that he was awake in the middle of the night with friends playing. We didn't realize so before, he needed some rest, he would be sleepy from waking up at 6:30 in the morning. But during the pandemic, there was no waking up early. 8:00 is not early so he could spend all night at the computer, playing video games and then go to school. So it had to be removed for several months in order to help him sleep and focus and it was the source of a lot of conflict. But it was removed and now it's better because it had to be removed, it was the only way.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, anyone else talking about social media use before the pandemic, any benefits or concerns you had before, any benefits or concerns now. Yeah, Parent 2?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nMy 10 year old has acquired a new habit, he now knows how to bleep talk thanks to gaming. So if you watch the Disney XD channel, they have people gaming and they bleep out the curses and he literally speaks like that. We didn't realize what it was and then I realized he's mimicking all the shows that bleep the curses out, he mimics that. I guess it's an incredible talent but his phone and his gaming, it's like a drug, it's an addiction. When I take it away, he goes ballistic but ... [crosstalk 00:43:25]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nBallistic. I know.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI have taken the phone and flung it out the front door and told him, if he's got to get it repaired, he's got to have the money because I'm not paying for it. But if you're going to ignore me, I've lost it, it's a drug.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:43:41] When I took the phone, mine ran away back to [inaudible 00:43:46], left the house with no [inaudible 00:43:47].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:43:47] So it sounds like it's been a really big point of frustration.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd then in the same sense, I guess I'm guilty because they'll sit there and they'll annoy you and annoy you until you either buy them Vbox or you buy them this or you buy them that and just to shut them up because you just can't take it anymore. You're like here's $20, or here's my credit card, go put $20 on for Vbox, I just ... [crosstalk 00:44:13] It's terrible.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 4, what has your children's experience been with social media before the pandemic, after, any benefits or concerns you got? \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSo I would say that things are shifting now because more things are opening back up, so sports and dance and what have you are starting to open back up and I think we've all gotten to a place where we're allowing people, them to go outside and play with their friends. But to take a little bit of a different approach when we were early on in the pandemic and they could not safely go see their friends or be outside, even though I don't love the games and what have you, I did appreciate the fact that they were interacting with other children over the games. Because at least then as opposed to just sitting with the video game on the screen by themselves and looking at it all day, they were laughing and playing and yelling and getting excited because there really was no alternative at that point in time.\\n\\n\\tAnd since then as things have opened back up, we've gone back to having more conversations about when we have a choice, you always choose the in-person activity to get some fresh air. But the benefit to me during the huge crisis of the pandemic was that it did allow them to interact with other children and not just be completely bored and what have you all day. And [inaudible 00:45:58], I work in a hospital and my husband had left. He doesn't speak to my three children, so they have very long days home alone and that became a comfort to them in a lot of ways too to be able to interact with other children during the day.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, so it sounds like both that it gave them an activity when there weren't very many activities and also a way to feel connected and socialize at a time that they couldn't go ... Thanks, Parent 4. Okay, so now, this is the last question. So now that we're going back to more in-person activities, any thoughts or aspects of social media or gaming that you would like to see stay or any aspects that definitely should go? And I know people have shared this a little bit but any last thoughts?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI'm in Jersey so we're still basically in lockdown because two kids had COVID and they locked down again, just when things started to open up. So we're still basically locked down on most activities, so I'm still on standby waiting for that. But we're going to parks, we're going outside, we're in the yard, we're doing other things trying to stay focused until sports and stuff open back up.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo building on other things while you can.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYou know, it's quite funny is that Jersey is still on lockdown for sports but a lot of our Staten Island sports are played in Jersey.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:47:43]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI can't figure that one.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 3, what were you going to say?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, I just wanted to say that I think all the technology is here to stay, it's not going to change, it may even get worse but at the end of the day as parents, we need to take control of these things and we need to continue being parents. It's our job and our responsibility so yes, all these distractions are going to be there, gaming, it's going to be there, social media, all of that and I don't expect the world to change for me. I've learned a lot now. I see how social media and technology can be really good and sometimes it can be really bad, too.\\n\\n\\tSo no excuse for me to blame anything other than myself as a parent and how I need to dedicate time to make sure my son is doing his work and getting enough sleep and not playing and things like that. At the end of the day, I take full responsibility for how he's learning and if he's not, then I need to make some changes. I don't know, technology's great. I'm learning accounting right now in front of a screen every day. It's just great and we have so many good things. I can't have that taken away, so we need to regulate it for them and ourselves primarily.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThank you for sharing that, Parent 3. So I think that's a good place to end. So Parent 5, I saw that you just joined. I'm sorry that we actually finished the conversation. [crosstalk 00:49:31]\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah, it was just my information just actually let me log in. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nI'm sorry. So maybe you and Administrator can touch base after and see if you can join another group or something.  But [crosstalk 00:49:45] I want to thank you so much for sharing your perspectives and this is really important information, just everyone's insights. And it's really helpful to help us understand your experience so really thank you so much.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo Administrator, do you want to just end us up?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nYeah, just to reiterate what Moderator 1 said, thank you guys so much just for all the information that you guys gave us today. It's very consistent with the information that we've seen from all the other groups. And we're just taking all this information to have this town hall meeting in either May or June which you guys will be invited to, of course. So yes, thank you guys so much for all the insight that you guys provided us with today.\\n\\n\\tIn regards to compensation, after this is over, I'll be sending everyone's information to our administrator. So you should receive it no later than Wednesday. So I would say about Wednesday, if you don't receive compensation, please do not hesitate to either email me or to give me a call. You should expect to receive an email from Amazon that says Healthy Brain Network attached to it. It's a $50 Amazon gift card so just be on the lookout for that. So yeah, if you don't receive it by end of day on Wednesday, just please reach out to me and we will work on getting you guys your compensation.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right, thank you, everyone. Enjoy the rest of the afternoon.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYou, too. Thank you.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you, guys, for doing this.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you, bye. [crosstalk 00:51:23]\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBye-bye.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOur pleasure.\"b'Parent 1:\\n\\nHello? Let\\'s see. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nHello.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi. Did that work?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYes, I\\'m just waiting for the meeting to start.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay. Trying it from my phone. I usually do it from my computer. I wasn\\'t sure if it was going to work. Nice. I guess I\\'ll call him back, at 2:15, I think it is. Oh, I was told 2:00 to 3:15.\\n\\n\\tWhat does your thing say, 2:00?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWait, wait, let me see. Hold on. Stay there. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIt says...\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh yeah, 2:00. Oh yeah, you\\'re right. Wow. 2:00 to 3:15. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nCan you hear me?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI can hear you fine, yeah. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAll right. Cool. I guess we have to wait for, it says, host is not in the meeting yet.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAll right. I guess we\\'re two minutes early, right?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nEveryone, good afternoon. Thank you so much for joining. I think... let\\'s see. We have four people here, so I\\'m just going to wait to see if we get anyone else. Hopefully we\\'ll get started in a minute or two. While we\\'re waiting, [crosstalk 00:04:02]. \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nI\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNo, it\\'s all right. While we\\'re waiting to see if anyone else signs on, if you could grab a paper and pen, we\\'re going to be writing something at a certain point.\\n\\n\\tOkay. I\\'m not sure if anyone else is signing on, but I think we can get started in the meantime, [Administrator 00:06:05]. Yeah? All right. \\n\\n\\tFirst of all, thank you all so much for taking out some time to join us and give us some more information about your experiences during this time. We really appreciated everyone filling out a crisis survey. The purpose of this group is to just go a little bit more in depth and hear about individual experiences. Before we get started, maybe we could just go around, introduce ourselves. Just say your name and maybe the ages of your children. Then we\\'ll go from there. \\n\\n\\tHi, my name is [Moderator 1 00:06:51]. I work with the Healthy Brain Network. I\\'m a neuropsychologist. I\\'m excited to meet you all. [Parent 3 00:07:00], do you want to go next?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nSure. Hi, my name is Parent 3. My son is now 16 that was involved with the Healthy Brain Network.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Great. Do you have other kids?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOh yeah, I got a whole bunch. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nMy oldest daughter is 35. My twins, they\\'ll be 22. [Terry 00:08:46] is 16 and my grandson is 14. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nNice. Okay. So for the purposes of this conversation, feel free to share information about any of them and how they\\'ve been affected. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 3.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, who wants to go next? [Parent 1 00:07:48], since you\\'re off mute. You want to introduce yourself?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi, my name is Parent 1. My son is 16 years old, and we went to the Healthy Brain Network back in 2018, I believe, 2019. Yep. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. A couple years ago. Well, nice to see you again. Thanks for joining us.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you. Likewise. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[Parent 4 00:08:17], you want to introduce yourself?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHi. Yes, I\\'m Parent 4. I have three kids. [Parent 4, Child 1 00:08:25] is 20 and he\\'s the one who I think is mostly the discussion will be around. I also have a 18 year old and a 15 year old who also did the testing with the Healthy Brain Network. My oldest and youngest did a couple years back.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGreat. Okay. Thank you. Nice to see you again too. [Parent 2 00:08:46]?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI have a 17 year old daughter, which is the one that I\\'m going to start this for, and an almost 14-year-old, two more weeks, son. They both got tested at the Healthy Brain about three years ago.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, a while back. Great. Well, thank you everyone for joining us again. In order to focus us and start off with a conversation, I want you to take a couple minutes to try to write down a couple of positive ways that technology has impacted your children since the start of the pandemic, and then a couple of negative ways that technology has impacted your children over the course of the pandemic. Then we\\'ll discuss it. \\n\\n\\tAfter you\\'re finished jotting a couple down in each category, I\\'d like you to think which category has had the biggest overall impact. Have the positive parts of technology had a bigger overall impact on your children, or the negative parts? Circle whichever one has had the bigger overall impact. \\n\\n\\tOkay. Who from the group circled the negative as having the bigger overall impact? Parent 2, you said the negative side has had the bigger overall impact. Anyone else feel like the negative parts of technology have been the bigger part overall? Who circled the positive side as having the bigger overall impact? Parent 4 you [inaudible 00:11:44] overall more positive. Parent 3, overall more positive. Parent 1, are you somewhere in the middle?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nSomewhere in the middle, yes.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Okay. All right. I\\'m interested to get into that. For the first part of the conversation I want to just think a little bit about how technology has impacted your children\\'s education. Focusing on the educational aspect. If someone could share how was technology used for education before the pandemic. Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Then how did that change once the pandemic hit? How was technology used? Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Who wants to start us off?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI will.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s ever been a... I\\'m answering this all specific to my daughter. If it was my son [crosstalk 00:12:46] it would be very different. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, yeah. We want to hear your specific experience. We know... I actually meant to say that a lot of times what we\\'re seeing is that people have overlapping experiences and some people have very unique experiences. We really want to hear all of it. Please feel free to chime in if your experience has been different in some way. It\\'s all really...\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m just saying... I\\'m specifying one of my two children, because they couldn\\'t be more different when it comes to this. \\n\\n\\tFor her, even textbooks being online is not a good thing. We still requested paper textbooks for her, because anytime she\\'s on a screen it\\'s never really been positive. Smartboards, and things like that at school aside, because obviously those are technology and I think they\\'re positive. She literally... \\n\\n\\tOur school went to complete Zoom, like most did... although we went faster than I know some districts did. On Friday school was closed and on Monday school was on Zoom. They the whole time had run it the full day, just exactly like it would be in school, which I know increases the Zoom fatigue, but for her... She shut down. She stopped doing any work. She stopped doing anything. She would sign in to her Zooms, but it was like she wasn\\'t even there. She would have other screens open and other devices open. She\\'d be on Buzzfeed or something else. She would show up to extracurriculars that were on Zoom, but she\\'d do the same thing. She was not present. She wasn\\'t present in our family. She wasn\\'t present in anything. She just completely shut down. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWow. Do you think that that was a specific barrier of having difficulty engaging with technology, or did she just shut down overall with all the stress?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI think that she was scared. I think that she does not like not having that human, true, eye-to-eye contact. She really needs that. She needs people to bring her back, focused, and pay attention to her in a real way that you can\\'t get on Zoom. And I think there are too many distractions. There are too many other tabs that are really, really, enticing. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Yeah. The distractions and not having the human element of [inaudible 00:14:48]. Thank you Parent 2. \\n\\n\\tSomeone else share what role technology played in your child\\'s education before the pandemic. Concerns, benefits, and then, maybe, how that changed...\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI can go [crosstalk 00:15:08].\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThat\\'s all right. Parent 3, go for it.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI think before Covid, my son learned how to use technology to support him in his work, to fill in the gaps of knowledge. I put... all my answers, I put both positive and negative. That was before Covid. Technology overall allows him to be exposed to things before they\\'re mature enough to handle, anyways. That\\'s a negative. Everything I see has positives and negatives. \\n\\n\\tOnce Covid started... He has ADHD, so being in the classroom with the other kids was an automatic distraction. The teachers were always, \"He can\\'t pay attention. He can\\'t sit still.\" It was always something. \\n\\n\\tLearning at home, I was able to... That first semester, last spring, I was able to sit right next to him. Oh, okay. We\\'re going to work. I\\'m the power, you know? I was able to show him better habits of learning and work, which he was more independent this past fall. He did better with the computer. I think being out of the classroom and at home cut some of the distractions. He was able to focus a bit better to see exactly what was impeding his progress in the classroom, and what wasn\\'t. That was a positive. \\n\\n\\tI think the entertainment systems, like the Xbox and... The Xbox was just entertainment, because you can\\'t go outside. It was a form of entertainment for him. On a positive note, the phone gave him access to his friends so he didn\\'t feel as isolated. [crosstalk 00:17:22] Those were the positive aspects of [crosstalk 00:17:24]. He\\'s a social kid.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. Having access to that social part was important. I actually want to hear more about that. We\\'re going to talk about social media more in depth later, but that\\'s interesting to hear on the educational side. That you saw both of those sides. That he\\'s at risk of getting exposed to some things that he\\'s not ready for, but also that you see that, for him specifically, it\\'s been less distracting and he\\'s been able to develop some good work skills. \\n\\n\\tParent 1 or Parent 4? I know, Parent 4, you were about to speak before. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOh, yeah. Sure.\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s interesting because it is different for each of my kids. I\\'m going to discuss how I feel in terms of the positives for my oldest. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, sure.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWho is 20. He\\'s at community college. Right before Covid started he was doing... it would have been his second semester of his freshman year. He started having bad anxiety, he sometimes gets... in front of people he gets a lot of anxiety... around new situations... He didn\\'t want to finish school. He wanted to take a semester break. He had a thing about being in front of people he didn\\'t know, and not knowing what he was capable of. So he took a break. \\n\\n\\tThen in the fall, when it switched to... the only choice was remote, or online learning, he\\'s like, \"Okay, I\\'ll give it a shot.\" He actually was very successful. He did really well. The teachers were... He also only took three classes instead of four or five, to make it easier. The teachers were accommodating, and he was able to go at his own pace. It was better because he didn\\'t even have to... they don\\'t have to show their faces on Zoom. He got a good, positive, outcome. He actually went back again this spring, and he\\'s doing really well. That\\'s where I think, in his case, it was positive to have class online. \\n\\n\\tI would completely disagree for my other two kids in high school. Absolutely not. They take advantage of being at home and having their devices. But anyway... The positive for Parent 4, Child 1 was that he could actually go back to school and not have to feel intimidated or anxious around other people. \\n\\n\\tThe other positive for him is, in between this, he also got a job through DoorDash, and now Uber Eats, where he is driving part time. Again, doesn\\'t have to really socialize with too much people. A lot of people just have the drop off deliveries. Enough where he\\'s feeling more comfortable when he grabs the food, or says thank you. It\\'s helped him a lot, and the technology is how he takes the orders. It\\'s all through the phone. He has to correspond through the phone, and if he has difficulties he has to go through their help desk online. It\\'s really helped him become very independent, and very self-sufficient. He\\'s grown tremendously in terms of his self esteem, just doing these two things and having the ability to do that just in the last six months. I guess that\\'s the biggest positive I can say that came out of this. Among other things.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. No. That\\'s really interesting to hear. To hear just how it impacted your kids so differently.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHe\\'s already panicked about going back in the fall. He doesn\\'t know if he wants to go back now that it\\'s back in person again, but that\\'s another conversation.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, I know, and I\\'m going to ask about that, because we\\'re definitely trying to think about trying to anticipate going back, also.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay, and Parent 1. What has your experience been? What was your thinking about technology for education before the pandemic? Have you seen concerns or benefits?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'ve seen benefits with my son, Parent 1, Child 1, being that... In 2019/2018 we were both overwhelmed with all the papers that the school were giving and sending home. It was just overwhelming to even look at it. Now that everything is organized on the computer that he has from school, it\\'s just a click away. It\\'s either multiple choice, or fill-in, and he gets it done. \\n\\n\\tNow he\\'s in high school and I feel that I can help him more. Meaning at the end of the quarter I can see what he\\'s missing, and I can, myself, tell him, \"Parent 1, Child 1, get this done. You\\'re missing this, this, and this.\" I can sit next to him and watch him get it done, and check up on him. Also, I communicate regularly with his teachers to make sure that he\\'ll pass on to the 10th grade. \\n\\n\\tIn the 5th grade, he got left back. Yes, because it was just too much. Too much paper. Too much everything. Too overwhelming. In class, he would fall asleep. Here he has no choice. I\\'m here. I\\'m home. I\\'m going to be barging in his room like, \"What are you doing?\" I can check up on him. \\n\\n\\tI also feel like he likes it more. He doesn\\'t... he has not complained at all about him wanting to go back to school. I do have him in hybrid, where he goes twice a week, which is good. He needs to get moving. He\\'s a little bit husky. That\\'s a negative that I find in not going to school. Not being able to mobilize and get your steps in. \\n\\n\\tYeah... that\\'s a benefit. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:22:58] So for the hybrid, when he goes, is he online at school? Or is he have in person instruction?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHe has in person instruction, twice a week.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThen another negative is not getting his steps in, and he\\'s husky. Another thing is not socializing. Not making new friends. When he was in the 5th grade, 6th grade, 7th grade, 8th grade, he had so many friends. I would hear him on the phone... or he would be like, \"Mom, I\\'m going to go out to eat with my friends from school.\" Now that\\'s gone. It bothers me, because now he\\'d on his PlayStation all the time. All the time. Now you hear him... he\\'s talked to his friends only virtually, never physically, which I believe is important. \\n\\n\\tThat\\'s pretty much it. It\\'s hard to get him out of the house too, on a regular day basis. I try to take him to the gym, or take him outside to get some sun. His vitamin D is very low. It just scares me sometimes. I don\\'t know. It\\'s hard to also make him take a vitamin D pill. Those are my concerns. His health, socializing... I don\\'t want him to have anxiety when he\\'s back in the public and everybody\\'s back in school. The rush... the rat race, the trains, the bus. He takes the bus, by himself, to school. That\\'s pretty much it. \\n\\n\\tBut I like it. I like it because he has a chance to pass his classes, and I can see everything that\\'s happening because it\\'s right there on the computer. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. It sounds like from the academic perspective, and that education perspective, it\\'s been very good for him. You being able to support him, being organized, and...\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nBut, you have other concerns, like socially, health, and things like that. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMm-hmm (affirmative)\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nAll right. Thank you all for outlining that. \\n\\n\\tNow, my next question is as we do start to return more in person and as people are starting to go back to school... What concerns do you have? What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYou asking me or...\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nEveryone. Everyone. Yes. Parent 1 if you want you can start us off [crosstalk 00:25:36]\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes I can say it, because I already have it in my head and I [crosstalk 00:25:38] anxiety of meeting new kids, his new classmates, and the anxiety of making new friends, if they\\'re going to like him. Things that all of us go through as humans, but he\\'s 16. I don\\'t want him to be peer pressured something to just fit in a group. I want it to happen organically, but it hasn\\'t... It\\'s just hard.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah, I hear that. The anxiety can be made worse by not being in school for so long and not having to cope with that in a while. I hear what you\\'re saying.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOne more thing is that at his school they\\'re doing the Covid testing, through a [inaudible 00:26:21], which is okay with me. They wear masks. I guess it\\'s all good on my side. As far as Covid [crosstalk 00:26:35] \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nConcerns about Covid. Okay.\\n\\n\\tAnyone else? Challenges that you\\'re anticipating your children facing?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI can tell you that my daughter is actually back in school full time. Despite that, she\\'s concerned because more kids keep coming back. First of all, I think they need to learn to be social in the manner that they were before. I think they\\'ve lost that skill. They have to re-find their comfort and figure that out. \\n\\n\\tI also think there\\'s definitely an underlining sense of fear, or nerves, depending on the kid. For a kid like mine, it\\'s fear. Some are just nervous about interacting in a close physical space even though there are masks, and some people are being tested and everything. An extra kid showed up in Math and they put all the seating closer together. Everybody in the Math class was so uneasy. Teacher and kids. They felt too close to each other because now they have this whole mentality that that\\'s potentially dangerous. That\\'s not going to go away in a minute. Next year they\\'re all going to be back in school, and they\\'re going to be closer together. They have to figure out how to navigate all that again, which I think is a definite challenge. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight, yeah. People are uncomfortable with that. They need to get eased back in to it. Both teachers and [crosstalk 00:27:47]. Interesting. Parent 3?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI think with my son, he\\'s asking... Right now he\\'s in a smaller school, but he\\'s asking when he goes back, can he go to one of the big, huge, schools on Staten Island? I\\'m worried that if we do put him in a larger school that he\\'ll lose some of the gains that he\\'s made as far as his academics are concerned. \\n\\n\\tA counter to that, I can see the maturity that he has... I can see his growth over this last year, so I wonder how he\\'s going to handle big school, small school, whatever it is. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Hopefully he can take some of those skills that he\\'s gained and bring them in when he goes back. It sounds like there are some challenges you\\'re concerned about as well.\\n\\n\\tI see we have someone new with us. [Parent 5 00:29:03]. Did I say your name correctly? Hi. Thank you for joining. Can you hear us? Oh.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nGone.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Parent 4, can you talk to us a little bit about any challenges you\\'re anticipating with your kids going back to school?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. Again, the younger one I\\'m not concerned about. He needs to be in school. \\n\\n\\tThe older one that I was talking about that has the anxiety... They all have different forms, but the one who is worried about going back to school in the fall and not even sure if he wants to go back. I don\\'t think it\\'s because of the programming. I think it\\'s because of the social component. He went to a smaller out-of-district private school. He knew everybody there. He felt popular. He felt comfortable being around people. Put him in a bigger environment... he\\'s very nervous about that. \\n\\n\\tI\\'ve been trying to reassure him that now that he\\'s selected his major, and he only has major courses left, it\\'s going to be the same people he knows. He\\'s starting to see that. They did have to go in yesterday, and they had to go in a couple weeks ago... It\\'s a photography major. He even came home and felt comfortable because he had met some of the people in person. He\\'s like, \"These people, some of them have all four classes with me this semester.\" He\\'s finding that some of them are probably going to take the same classes in the fall because they\\'re only offered in the fall... certain ones.\\n\\n\\tI\\'m hoping I can coax/urge him, encourage him to go, but I do see he keeps putting it off. He\\'s like, \"I don\\'t know. I\\'m not really sure. I haven\\'t decided what I want to do yet.\" He\\'s 20. You want to have him make his own choices as an adult, but yet he\\'s an immature 20 year old, an inexperienced 20 year old. I almost feel like I have to push him in the direction... not that I want him to go, necessarily... but where I think he\\'s capable of going but he doesn\\'t quite see that yet. That\\'s the challenges that I have. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks for sharing that, Parent 4.\\n\\n\\tParent 5, can you hear us okay? I see you\\'re on mute now.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOkay, can you hear me?\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYes. Hi. Thank you so much for joining.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHi, how are you guys? How you doing? Good afternoon everyone. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGood afternoon. To catch you up a little bit, we\\'ve been discussing how technology has impacted kid\\'s education over the course of the pandemic. Hi [Parent 6 00:31:39], thank you for joining.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nHi.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYou and Parent 5 just joined us so I\\'m just touching back up. We\\'re just talking about how technology has impacted your kid\\'s education over the course of the pandemic. Sharing both some positives and negatives that people have experienced. This is actually perfect timing. If Parent 5, would introduce yourself and the age of your kid. If you could speak a little bit about how you\\'ve seen technology affect your kid\\'s education. Concerns...\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOkay. I have three children. One of them just turned two in March. He\\'s not going remote learning, but he does use his technology. He already has a tablet. He already knows how to work everybody\\'s phone. FaceTime. All of that. With him alone we used to get up, \"Let\\'s watch channel 13, Sesame Street,\" educational programs, stuff like that. He\\'s like, \"No.\" He needs his tablet to do his homework, is what he tells us. He needs his tablet to do his homework. What he\\'s doing is mimicking everybody else, because he sees everybody else with a device, and doing something on the device. \\n\\n\\tMy daughter, she\\'s 10. She goes to [Success Academy 00:33:15], but she\\'s been doing remote learning the longest. Success Academy were one of the first charters to go remote, even before the Mayor and everybody else was going to do the remote thing. They stopped the kids from coming in. They already had them going remote. My daughter\\'s 10 and she\\'s being doing remote learning for about a year and a half now. \\n\\n\\tI feel like it\\'s counter productive, because I have to obsessively stay on her back. Where they give the kids a itinerary that they want... like when you go to college, you get your course itinerary. You got to go on. You got to be responsible for doing your assignments and turning them in on time. Stuff like that. That\\'s how they\\'re running the program. I feel like for self starters... for kids who are on the ball and you can give them directions and they can go follow them without anything... it\\'s good for those types of kids. If your kid guides off for five minutes or gets side tracked, it\\'s counter productive because you got to stay on they back. I have to know exactly what you supposed to be doing so I can know if you\\'re not doing it properly. Stuff like that.\\n\\n\\tYou got these kids staring at a screen all day. They\\'re doing Zoom in class, but they not staying attentive.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nOkay. Parent 5 what I\\'m hearing from you is that you have to stay on them for it to be anything. You\\'re finding they\\'re not really so engaged.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah. For a while she\\'ll be doing whatever they\\'re doing. I feel like adults do this too. You guiding off. Now you\\'re looking at YouTube. You\\'re checking your Facebook. You\\'re looking at Instagram. You\\'re supposed to be doing math.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt can be distracting.\\n\\n\\tParent 6 can you share with us a little bit about your children\\'s experience in terms of how has the technology impacted their education?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI have six kids. The one that I did the questionnaire for, she\\'s 11. I don\\'t know if you want to know about everybody, or about just that one.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nJust share. If it\\'s affected your kids differently, you could talk about that. If you notice general themes or trends.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nMy kids were on Zoom full time like everybody else last year from March until June. That was definitely a huge adjustment. They definitely weren\\'t able to attend as well as far as school. Their screen usage rally picked up. It was because now they had a screen. My kids, before then, didn\\'t have access to screens in such a capacity. I don\\'t have that many screens in my house. I only have one TV. Only two of my kids have phones. \\n\\n\\tThere wasn\\'t this intense access and awareness of what they could be doing on a screen until Zoom started. Zoom was incredibly difficult for all of them to keep up, to study, to learn, to know. They didn\\'t know what was flying. Like the mother that just spoke said, I had to be on top of everybody\\'s Zoom. It\\'s six kids. It was impossible for me to remote work when I was supposed to be working. \\n\\n\\tThis year my kids are all in school. They go to private school. They\\'re all in school. Save for a few quarantines that they had to go through, the school did go on Zoom for a short while. The goal waS to get the kids back in the classroom. The screen situation didn\\'t really get much better. They feel more comfortable communicating on a screen, now, with their friends. They need to FaceTime. They need to Zoom. They actually Zoom in groups with their friends now. If they study they can\\'t study on their own. [crosstalk 00:38:12] ROBLOX.\\n\\n\\tMy 11 year old is definitely by far the hardest of all of them. She went from being on a computer and being a watcher to becoming... ROBLOX is the thing that she wants to do all the time. She\\'ll grab my phone and say, \"I want to text my friends\", but inevitably she ends up doing a gaming. I hate it. Then she says she\\'s gaming with her friends. She\\'ll game and then FaceTime at the same time. No one else plays ROBLOX but her. I don\\'t allow her to direct message anybody or accept anybody\\'s messages on ROBLOX. That became a huge... it\\'s a battle. There\\'s no saving from that. I don\\'t allow social media for my kids. It just... everyday.\\n\\n\\tThere came a point a few weeks ago I actually removed all the computers from my house, because they don\\'t need to be on Zoom. They\\'re not on Zoom... My 11 year old has to deal with it. I don\\'t like... I literally took... We had three laptops, I sent them to my husband\\'s office. I said keep them there. I told him he\\'s not allowed to bring home his laptop unless we really have to do work.\\n\\n\\tIt did help, but... We\\'re ultimate technologically connected we... [crosstalk 00:39:49]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nIt sounds like it\\'s been a source of stress. Even as they return back to school you\\'re still seeing that by [crosstalk 00:40:00] a big...\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nHuge. Zoom school really isn\\'t school.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. [crosstalk 00:40:05]\\n\\n\\tOkay. Thank you, Parent 6.\\n\\n\\tNow I\\'d like to shift the conversation away from a focus on education and focus more on, what you guys have all been touching on, which is social media right Administrator? [crosstalk 00:40:26] Thinking about your children\\'s social media use before the pandemic and what that looked like. Was it something you saw as beneficial? Did you have concerns? How did that shift as it comes to... the pandemic hit? What concerns you have? What benefits have you seen from your children\\'s social media use?\\n\\n\\tI know we heard from Parent 6 about her child. Does anyone else want to... Parent 3? I\\'m sorry Parent 3, you\\'re the first one on my screen, so I keep...\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThat\\'s okay. [crosstalk 00:41:01]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nGo for it.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nHe\\'s not... Before Covid, and now, he\\'s not so much prone to pick up the computer to do anything, make any transactions, scroll, or anything like that, but the phone... When we gave him the phone, our cell phone carrier has an app that we have on our phones so that we can control what he can access. We still have that in place. It has a bedtime on it when you can\\'t access the internet. You can shut down sites one by one where he can\\'t access. We\\'ve still had to do that. \\n\\n\\tThe good thing about social media is that during Covid he could still have access to his friends... that he could talk to and still share life with. I found it to be a positive for him.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nThanks Parent 3. Who wants to share their experiences with social media, both before and after?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nWell I would like to say something about that. I believe her name was miss Parent 6, that spoke after me. When she mentioned her 11 year old and the ROBLOX... Oh my goodness. Before Covid, social media for my daughter was a reward. Like, \"Oh mommy, I finished doing whatever I have to do. I took care of my responsibilities. Can I use the phone now?\" I would give her the phone, and she would be able to, \"Can I make a TikTok? Can I do this, can I do that?\"\\n\\n\\tNow, because you have to have a device consistently, to me, it slightly took away a piece of my control level. Now you\\'re on the screen all the time, you can just click and I don\\'t see. I don\\'t see what you\\'re clicking. I don\\'t see what you doing. I don\\'t see what you looking at. I don\\'t see what you watch, because I\\'m under the presumption that she\\'s sitting at your thing and you\\'re doing your work. You\\'re looking at the screen because you supposed to be doing your work, your homework, your this or your that... but you could be looking at the screen and guiding off. There\\'s been a couple times she was in class guiding off, and the teacher\\'s now texting me, \"We\\'re doing math and [Genesis 00:43:55] is trying to get on Instagram.\" \\n\\n\\tI feel like it changed the dynamic of what they\\'re doing. Like, what do you mean? I need the phone. I need to be on this, and I got to be on that. I got to check this now. I\\'m like, none of that is important. What\\'s important is did you do your work? Did you check your work? Did you submit your work? After you\\'ve done that, you can have free time to do what you want on the phone. You want to play ROBLOX... they even incorporated that in school. \\n\\n\\tIn school there used to be a little time for them to get a reward, or maybe to play a game, something like that so they could interact with each other. Now they got it on the phone. Now they got ROBLOX club. They got this, and they got that. Now when they give the kids the 20 minutes-30 minutes of free time where the kids could be inter... even though we\\'re on Zoom... I could\\'ve done a class, or play a math game. They do that once in a while. \\n\\n\\tNow everybody\\'s in a breakout room, and you guys got 30 minutes to play ROBLOX together. I feel like it\\'s taken over. [crosstalk 00:45:23] I feel like there\\'s no separation between the time to what you supposed to be doing certain things.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s interesting. The comparison that you made from before. That it was a reward, or something extra. It wasn\\'t assumed that it could be this core part of everything, but now it\\'s... it was bound to [crosstalk 00:45:53]\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nJust let me pick up the device and do whatever I want to do on it. It\\'s not even about asking permission anymore. I\\'ve really noticed the change because now the two year old, the baby... Whenever I put my phone down, he picks my phone up. He don\\'t call it ROBLOX, he says, \"I want to play Mario.\" He has my phone, and mind you, my phone has a password on it and everything. The baby picks my phone up and somehow he gets in to ROBLOX every time. He be playing ROBLOX on my phone.\\n\\n\\tYou learn this behavior from the 10 year old.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. That\\'s what they\\'re seeing. All right. Thank you, Parent 5.\\n\\n\\tCan anyone else share what your experience has been with social media? How were they using it before the pandemic? Do you see it as something that\\'s beneficial, or were you concerned from before, and how did that change?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSo [crosstalk 00:47:00] I don\\'t allow my kids to have Instagram, TikTok, or any of that. I also consider WhatsApp social media [crosstalk 00:47:10] They have this intense pressure. I have a 16 year old and a 14 year old. I find that... We all grew up without phones so we understand what it is to be home, and not necessarily have to communicate to the world every little thing we\\'re doing. Every little thing that we\\'re eating. They find this intense pressure to be on all the time. All the time they have to have something relevant, something that\\'s cool, something they\\'re eating, something they\\'re showing, a selfie. I find it endless. \\n\\n\\tIt definitely became worse now, because during Zoom they were spending all that time in their room. Now they\\'re still spending all that time in their room. I\\'m like, can you come up? My two oldest girls, their rooms in the basement. I\\'m like, \"I need you to come upstairs. Come out of your room, and put your phones down.\" \\n\\n\\tI actually started a new policy with them that they need to charge their phones in the kitchen because they\\'re not sleeping. Even with all this screen time boundaries that I put on them, somehow they manage to do something or other. One of my daughters actually... I\\'m Sabbath observant, so we don\\'t use phones Friday night to Saturday night. We do not touch our phones. We don\\'t turn on our phones. We don\\'t use electric. We don\\'t use television. We don\\'t use anything. It\\'s actually the biggest blessing in the world because it\\'s a religious requirement. We\\'re bound. We don\\'t do it. It\\'s something that... We all are able to release our phones because it\\'s from birth. I don\\'t use my phone on Friday night and Saturday. I find that on those nights, there\\'s so much more... There\\'s just so calm. You can see there\\'s less pressure on them to have to connect. We never connected like this with society when we were kids. We run home we did our homework. We could barely get the phone because our sister was on the phone. \\n\\n\\t[crosstalk 00:49:24] that negative where we couldn\\'t use the phone. There\\'s lot of battle. It\\'s a lot of battle. The minute that my Sabbath ends, my 11 year old is on some device, coming to me saying, \"Can you please unlock this device so I can use it?\" I worry about how they\\'re going to turn out, because I think that these devices... you said something about the good about social media. I don\\'t think there\\'s any good in social media, at all. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nSo you\\'ve noticed it become a much bigger struggle.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:50:00] much trouble, and I don\\'t even have TikTok. I do not allow them... I will not... That influence just has to stay out. It\\'s enough. They get it on their WhatsApps. They get screen recordings of it. As long as at least they\\'re not connected to another... and they\\'re begging me, \"Why not?\" I said... for instance Snapchat, I have a friend who\\'s daughter actually wanted to do plastic surgery because the filters make them look so much better [crosstalk 00:50:35]. I don\\'t understand how the whole tech society is okay with doing this to society\\'s children. It\\'s honestly mind boggling. [crosstalk 00:50:48]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nRight. Thank you Parent 6.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI also think we\\'ve relaxed... or at least I have relaxed some of my rules and time that I\\'ve allowed the kids to be on things [crosstalk 00:51:00] at least. At some point, it entertains them instead of me having to entertain them, especially during the beginning of Covid when they couldn\\'t be with their friends. Right?\\n\\n\\tMy neighbor kept making fun of me for how much time I was spending outside playing basketball, doing relay races, collecting golf balls, and doing other things to keep him busy and off his devices. At some point, I have work, I have dishes to wash, I need five minutes not entertaining anyone, so okay, you can use it a little bit more. Then there are those ridiculous streaks that they have on some of these things. Where they have to and a message on Snapchat every day not to break the streak. He\\'ll sit there just on streaks. This is my... the one who uses devices less, watches the Simpsons while he walks up and down the steps, and then has to get on social media to talk to his friends about a particularly funny part. I\\'m like, \"You\\'re going to fall and get killed.\"\\n\\n\\tA lot of the fight is not left in me after them being home for over a year. You know what I mean? I\\'m wondering if it\\'s even going to be possible to pull back to where we were before Covid, when they go back to a more normal life. Have you loosened the restrictions and it\\'s so much harder now to tighten them again? They don\\'t see that it\\'s not good for them. You see it. You know, but sometimes you just don\\'t have the energy to do anything about. \\n\\n\\tAnd she is completely uncontrollable. She just [crosstalk 00:52:22] the best therapist in the world is Instagram. She follows every anxiety Instagram page there is, and thinks they\\'re the wisest [crosstalk 00:52:27] come from that. Again, I\\'ve locked my phone... or her phone... for screen time and things. She\\'ll sit there for hours trying to figure out [crosstalk 00:52:38]\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nParent 2, I think you\\'re bringing out an important point that a lot of parents have shared with us. That they\\'ve had to loosen the restrictions because there aren\\'t so many activities, and parents need to go get some nap time or their kids can do something independent. That\\'s definitely something we\\'ve heard from a lot of parents.\\n\\n\\tParent 4, can you share about the impact that social media has had on your kid?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy older son, for him he uses it as a means to communicate with people [crosstalk 00:53:19] so anxious. [crosstalk 00:53:24] public, or in new places he doesn\\'t feel very easy connecting to people. With social media he has that barrier of not being that face to face. I think he overuses it and it\\'s affecting his sleeping. He sleeps in, then he goes to sleep too late. He\\'s 20, I don\\'t know how much I want to be constantly taking his phone from him. I do try to put restrictions in terms of, you have to get up by a certain time and if you stay up late that\\'s going to be a problem. I can\\'t tell him how and when to sleep, but I can make him get up and be productive in the morning as much as possible, including giving him a couple morning classes when it\\'s time to help them sign up. \\n\\n\\tFor My 15 year old it\\'s really tough because I\\'m constantly finding him using it during school. They\\'re still remote... for the most part they\\'re remote more often than not. They just shut our school down again because high school has too many cases. I\\'m working from home. I\\'ll take his phone and I\\'ll tell him he can\\'t have it until between classes, or after class. Then I\\'ll go in there later and see it\\'s in his room again. It\\'s a constant battle. I feel like now I\\'ve got to be a control freak which I\\'m really trying not to do, and allow him to earn my trust, but it\\'s not always happening. \\n\\n\\tIt\\'s sick. My husband says some of these countries have these technology addiction rehab places that [crosstalk 00:54:46] to a drug rehab [crosstalk 00:54:51]. It\\'s scary because I honestly see my kids could be candidates, and I\\'m sure I\\'m not alone here. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt really depends on how and when they\\'re using it. If they\\'re using it to connect to people, that\\'s fine, but you have to be able to put your phone away and not feel deprived. [crosstalk 00:55:13] yourself if you don\\'t have your phone. It\\'s scary. It\\'s an ongoing battle. I fear how it\\'s going to... continue to get older and go less face to face. I see people texting each other when they\\'re sitting across the room from each other.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYes miss Parent 4.\\n\\n\\tI know because I can relate to so much that she\\'s saying. I feel like my daughter is addicted to having the telephone. When I be like, \"Give me your phone\", she be like, \"Why? What happened?\"\\n\\n\\tI found a video in my phone of my daughter crying because she could not find her telephone. She was like, \"The baby had my phone, and now I can\\'t find it.\" She was so utterly distraught. When I was your age I didn\\'t even have a phone. We didn\\'t grow up with cell phones. You\\'re addicted to having the device itself. \"Let me take a picture of my food. Let me take a picture of this. Let me make a TikTok right quick. Let me say that we\\'re going over here.\" Put the phone down. You can\\'t even eat food without the phone in your hand. I tell them no devices at the phone. Like miss Parent 4 said, we in the same house. You texting me from the back room? What is wrong with you? \\n\\n\\tIt\\'s becoming an obsession. I feel like our generation, we didn\\'t grow up having the phone. I remember I used to have to ask permission to even use the house phone at a certain time. That was after you did all your chores, or you did your homework. You know what I\\'m saying? It wasn\\'t just picking up the phone, using it. I really believe that Covid, the pandemic era, is causing other problems. They\\'re not being foreseen as a problem right now, but it\\'s definitely causing other problems. \\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Parent 5 thank you for outlining that. I think that\\'s the main goal of this is to really shed light on those types of experiences that were affecting a lot of people. People are struggling with something like you both said. Sounds like an addiction. [inaudible 00:57:53] Like I said, we\\'re hearing that from a lot of parents and I think it\\'s affecting all kids differently. \\n\\n\\tI think we\\'re almost out of time, but any other points that we haven\\'t brought up about any benefits or concerns that you\\'ve had about social media?\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOnly benefit I think social media... it kind of gives you a voice when you don\\'t have one. You can bring light to a problem. Like George Floyd. If we wouldn\\'t have visually saw what happened to George Floyd, the world wouldn\\'t have... the problem has always been underlying, but the fact that we were able to actually see it... In that situation, social media was helpful\\n\\n\\tThere\\'s good and bad in everything. I\\'m going to sum that up like that. Social media can be a good thing. It can be used for good. It can be used in a positive light. Then again, it can also be a negative. It could turn in to a negative aspect. You have to really control it. Like the other parents are saying. I even agree with miss Parent 2 when she was like, \"All right. When I need my five minutes, you can be on phone.\" Because I know that\\'s going to keep you content enough for me to get my five minutes.\\n\\n\\tNow if I be like, \"Give me the phone.\" They, \"Why. What happened? What did I do? Why are you taking it? I can\\'t look on this? I can\\'t do that\" I be like, \"No, Genesis, you can\\'t. Put the phone down for 10 minutes. Put it down for five minutes. Let me see you put it down for 15 minutes.\" This is a struggle for her. She can not.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nWhat I\\'m hearing is the moderation and the control is really the hard part. Yes, sorry Parent 3, I see you. [crosstalk 01:00:14] We have a couple more minutes.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nJust really quickly. Another concern of mine with the social media is that my son is 16, so there\\'s this element of sexuality that\\'s coming in to play that I saw this last year. I know they circulate pictures of young ladies. I\\'ve talked to him about... that would be considered trafficking, which is a felony. [crosstalk 01:00:49] tried to warn him about that and called one parent about her daughter. They\\'re sending pictures back and forth which leads to bullying and all kinds of trauma and drama. I just wanted to mention that that\\'s a concern.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s an important concern.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI\\'m glad you mentioned that. I forgot about that, because this one is 10, but that\\'s definitely... [crosstalk 01:01:20] yes it is.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI think that\\'s a two part challenge. We have to teach our kids to be careful with their social footprint. To understand that anything they put on social media is never, ever, going away. [crosstalk 01:01:34] Colleges will see it, jobs will see it, friends will see it. It\\'s never going away. You have to be very thoughtful and careful what you share, which is a hard lesson to teach them. And if you discover they already did something not really smart, it\\'s there already. Right? I think it\\'s extra hard because we didn\\'t grow up with any of this. We didn\\'t grow up with the opportunity to ruin our lives when we were kids. [crosstalk 01:01:59]\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNot in this way. [crosstalk 01:02:01]\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWe had to do something that could get in the newspaper. They share it all by themselves, so it\\'s an even bigger challenge because we didn\\'t have to deal with these things. Yet we have to teach them to be careful dealing with them.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\n[crosstalk 01:02:14] opening you mentioned their sexuality. I\\'m saying they\\'re really opening themselves up to... A very good friend of mine, her 14 year old daughter... I never heard this term before... but was being cat fished. What\\'s cat fishing, I have no idea. Somebody was trying to lure her. I find the reason I do so much filtering on their phones is because... it\\'s like throwing them in to an open arena where anything goes. My 16 year old... I think she didn\\'t realize what it was. I found it in her trash inbox. Not in her spam, but in her trash. All of these deleted porn email advertisements. She never [crosstalk 01:03:07]. I think she just kept deleting them, but when you opened one up it was blinding because there was no \"Click on this, XXX\" it was full on male, female nudity in an email. They can either get sucked in to something dangerous, or they could see something that just traumatizes them.\\n\\n\\tAs far as anything... I understand what the woman before me was speaking... she said about having a voice, but they also feel a pressure to have a voice. To have an opinion. To state their feelings. It\\'s a little much. They have to feel like they have to expose their entire lives so that they can fit in. That they said something meaningful.\\n\\nModerator 1:\\n\\nYeah. Parent 6 thank you. I\\'m going to cut in here. I appreciate everyone\\'s time. I know there\\'s a lot to say on this topic. I really have to thank all of you for sharing your experiences and your insights. It\\'s really helpful to us. It shines a spotlight on what people are going through. I\\'m going to let Administrator close [inaudible 01:04:30]. Thank you everyone. It was really nice meeting [crosstalk 01:04:34] I really appreciate all this. Okay.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nHi, can everyone hear me?\\n\\n\\t[crosstalk 01:04:39]\\n\\n\\tAwesome. I\\'m on two different devices. As young as I am, sometimes technology has me boggled too, especially when it comes to Zoom. Like Moderator 1 said, I want to thank you guys so much for your time today. The information that you guys gave us. A lot of the things you guys have said are very [inaudible 01:05:06] what we\\'ve been hearing. I really appreciated this group because you gave even more information about having a voice. Things that parents haven\\'t raised were raised within this group. We thank you guys so much for the information you provided us with. We\\'re collecting this information to not only do research, but to give you guys a town-hall-meeting where we basically discuss all the things that we\\'ve collected and, hopefully, give you insight on how to navigate what we call problematic internet usage throughout this time. Thank you guys so much for all of the information that you guys have provided us with. In regards to compensation, I\\'ll be sending out your emails to our administrator who sends out the compensation. I would say no later than Thursday should you receive compensation. If you don\\'t receive compensation by Thursday, please to do not hesitate to either email me or give me a call, and we will get that situated for you guys. Once again, thank you guys so much for all of the insight that you have provided us.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThank you for asking me to join.

My name is [Administrator 00:11:00]. I\\'m going to be... The research assistant that\\'s been contacting you all. We\\'re just waiting, oh, gosh. We\\'re just waiting for our clinician to hop on the call and then we\\'ll get started. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSure. \\n\\n\\t(silence).\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHi. Good afternoon, everyone.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nGood afternoon. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHi, I\\'m Moderator 2. Administrator, do we have everyone on? \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSorry, I\\'m also on the phone, as well. We\\'re supposed to have a group of six. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWe\\'re short two.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIt should be, yeah. We should be give it like another minute or two.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\n\\t(silence).\\n\\n\\tI think we\\'re going to go ahead and get started, Administrator. Hi, my name is Moderator 2. I am the project director for Healthy Brain Network. You have all been invited to participate in this focus group to talk about your children\\'s use of technology before and after or during, and yes, for after the pandemic. I always like to start with a just quick go around the room, tell me a little bit about yourself. If we could get your name, your child\\'s name, age and the most recent TV show you\\'ve binged. Does anyone want to get us started? \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI don\\'t mind starting. Yeah, my name is Parent 4, my son is Parent 4, Child 1, he\\'s 11. And he\\'s at Riverdale Country School and I am a guidance counselor for the DOE. What else am I supposed to say? Anything else?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nJust if you want to share the most recent show you\\'ve binged.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nWait, say that, oh, wow. Oh, my goodness. Them. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThe show Them, I watched that recently. That was a lot. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAll right, anyone want to go next? \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, I\\'ll go next. Hi, I\\'m Parent 3, Parent 3, Child 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mom. That\\'s what everybody calls me in the neighborhood, Parent 3, Child 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mom. My son is eight and I\\'m the Manhattan Borough Planner for New York City Transportation. What else? It so happens the last show I just binged, too, was Them, so that was in common. And that\\'s it, that\\'s all there is about me. I don\\'t know if there was some else I missed. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nNope, nothing at all. Anybody want to go next?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nHi, my name is Parent 1. I am the mom of three. I have my oldest son is 26. I have a 24 year old girl and then my youngest one is 16, Parent 1, Child 1. Parent 1, Child 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mom. We live in Secaucus and I\\'m a retired police officer. Thank God I retired five years ago. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m Parent 2. I have two kids. I have a son who\\'s 18 and then the daughter that I guess we\\'re talking about today, who is 13. I am a marketing consultant and I\\'ve not seen Them, but I just finished Serpent on Netflix. It was very good, based on a true story about a gem dealer internationally who murdered...\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nHello? What happened? You got interrupted. Anyone like to continue? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI guess I\\'ll go. Can you hear me? Can people hear me? I don\\'t know.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYes, we can. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOkay, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m on my phone because I can\\'t figure out my daughter\\'s password on the computer, she changed it again and she\\'s not home, so I apologize. My name is Parent 5, I\\'m a mom of three. I have, my daughter is 15, my son is 13, and my little one is 10, my second son is 10. I\\'m a para for the Department of Education in Staten Island and I don\\'t know. But I\\'m going to check out Serpent on Netflix.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSounds good. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYeah, so, was there anything else I need to say?\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nNope.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nBecause I missed the beginning. Okay. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWell, Parent 2, did we hear from you? Oh, okay. All right, so getting started. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nWait. I didn\\'t know we had to... I have three kids, by the way. I\\'m not only Parent 3, Child 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mom, but Parent 3, Child 1 is my last child. I have two others, a 14 year old, a 10 year old. Two girls and Parent 3, Child 1 is the only boy, and he\\'s the last. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nGot it. All right, so if we can go around, I like to do this exercise just thinking about your children\\'s use of technology during the pandemic. Can you write down three good qualities, three bad qualities and circle the most important of each? And then, we\\'ll just shared the most important ones. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nWe have to write it. I have to get up for a second, get a pen.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nYou can just say it if you want. For me, if I had to think about the... I would probably choose, that it give my kids better skills, they called family a lot and they were quiet so I could do work. On the negative end, there were a lot of endless games, bedtime became challenging and there was a lot of whining around times they weren\\'t allowed to use their iPads. Of those, I would probably say the most annoying was the whining and the best part was letting me work. Overall, I would say it was a positive. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI have to apologize, my camera\\'s been acting up all day today. I\\'ll just say the positives for Parent 4, Child 1 has been that he\\'s been able to communicate with his friends, he\\'s made new friends with gaming. And he\\'s learned to navigate multiple, new programs. Especially, through school, which I think has been good. And just how to use whether it\\'s the Schoolology or the music programs or the... In that sense, it\\'s been great and I think that\\'s something he can take, as well as other kids, too, be able to take with him moving forward.\\n\\n\\tThe negative though, yeah, is the constant gaming. And the I\\'m going to stay up while I know you\\'re sleeping at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning and get online. That has been a negative. And then, just the constant screen time I think is not that great for their eyes, in general. Those are my two main negatives. I don\\'t think I have, I don\\'t know if I have a third one. But the gaming and just the how it affects their eye.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay, did anybody else want to share theirs?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay, I\\'ll go. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOh, go ahead. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOh, I\\'m sorry. I think. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYou could go, Parent 1, it\\'s okay. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAll right, so for my 16 year old, before the pandemic, we had a set sleeping schedule. His grades were good, but there was a set sleeping schedule. During the pandemic and after the pandemic, that basically was interrupted and I was trying to over compensate for the amount of time being in the house and the lack of socialization with his friends, so the sleeping time was interrupted and it has continued. At this point, basically he goes to sleep whenever he\\'s really tired. \\n\\n\\tOne thing, that was one of the negative things that I, negative changes that we\\'re going through since the pandemic. I would say he became more introverted than before. One of the positive things has been his grades. Even though there hasn\\'t been a lot of interaction or he still remains at school from home, so home schooling. The grades have actually improved. He\\'s a high honors, though we did have the option to go back last week, five days a week. I chose to keep it the way it is to finish the year only because he has improved his grades and I want him to end the year with the grades that he has now. \\n\\n\\tOverall, the sleeping is like he\\'s sleeping less, the grades are higher. There\\'s less time spent with the friends but they do interact every day over text or over the games. And more online time. But overall, it\\'s okay.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOkay, so my positive was, no, my negatives were bedtime issues, sneakiness, of course, with of the iPad, like he would just be in certain areas and just trying to control the games that he\\'s on and if he\\'s meeting strangers. Those took a lot of, a little the work with me to manage that. But the positive is he started reading more and to help me with him not meeting strangers, my daughter started playing Roblox with him, so that was a plus. That kind of would help me to understand what game he\\'s playing and so forth.\\n\\n\\tAnd it helped me to see what was his struggles in school, because right before the pandemic, he was having these issues and so it\\'s through him being home and seeing how he worked with the computer is how I was able to finally learn how he learns and what he likes. Because he tends to keep things to himself. That was the positive. That\\'s it. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nOkay. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nFor me, the positive is that she\\'s able to connect with her friends. Especially, because she wasn\\'t allowed to see them for a lot of the pandemic. I thought online school, they did a good job. And by being online, I think she learned a lot of stuff. Negatively, as everyone said, she\\'s up to all hours of the night talking with her friends. And then, of course, I\\'m the bad mom because I\\'m the only one at midnight who\\'s like, \"Get off the device.\" \\n\\n\\tAnd the other part is she gets very sucked in to one, Roblox. Tiktok and videos and literally, it\\'s like she\\'s a zombie and when I ask her to do something, and she doesn\\'t respond and it\\'s annoying. And also, because she\\'s with her friends online and doing everything, she\\'s been spending a lot of time in her room, so she\\'ll rush through dinner so she can get back to being on the devices. But yet, this is her only interactions, so it\\'s hard to say no. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI completely understand that. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy son is going through the same thing. The time spent in the room, it has come to the point that he\\'s basically having all meals in the room because either he only has a certain amount of minutes, like three minutes, according to him, to have breakfast before he starts class. Lunch, they have different times every day, so by the time I ask him what\\'s today\\'s time for lunch? I\\'m preparing lunch, so basically he has to eat in his room. And dinner, just like what\\'s your name? Parent 2 said, it\\'s either very rushed to go back to the room or just bring it to the room because now there\\'s homework, they have to do more interaction, so that to me is one of the negative things, the time spent in the room away from everyone in the house. Then that to me it\\'s also and the times staying up at night to...\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI agree with the time in the room. My 15 year old, my oldest, she was struggling with it and we call her in her cave, like you need to get out of your cave, you need to get out of your cave. The good thing is we started watching some TV shows at night making every like certain nights of the week we\\'ll watch something together as a family and at least we get to socialize with them, because if not, I forget that she\\'s even home sometimes.\\n\\n\\tI don\\'t even know she\\'s there because she does not leave her room. Socialization has been a tremendous thing. My boys are in junior high, they finally went back full-time and yes, I sent them back full-time because I couldn\\'t wait for them to go back, remote didn\\'t work for them. And being a stay at home mom, being a working full-time at... is not the most convenient thing with three children. I became dependent on the Internet, like, \"Just take your iPad, go do something on your iPad.\" My little one, I was doing work at 11:00 at night with him and I was telling the teachers, \"You can\\'t mark him late, I work all day, I work after school jobs and I\\'m on the computer all day, I can\\'t maintain him and he has an IEP with needs and they\\'re not being met.\" \\n\\n\\tHe would get work done at 11:30 at night, so bedtime was a joke. It was like he could sleep all day because he\\'s out of my hair. And his academics, we\\'ll do at night with him. And my middle one didn\\'t do any academics that when he went back to school, he was just crying, \"Please let me stay home, please let me stay home.\" And I was just like, \"No, go to school. Goodbye, go to school crying, here\\'s some extra tissues.\" Call me cold and heartless but he needed to go back, and now he\\'s fine and he\\'s adapted to it. But two weeks of every day crying, \"Please don\\'t send me back to school.\"\\n\\n\\tInternet, like I said, it was good for me, it was a babysitter when I needed them out of my hair so I can do my job. But it\\'s killing me. It\\'s ruining this generation completely. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI completely understand. What are some of your thoughts around how your child used technology before the pandemic, during and now on their return to full-time? Some of your concerns? \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI think once he played games and video, I didn\\'t... It was a few hours when she got home from school. And she was at school all day and she also would have after school activities and dinner normally. And so, while she did some of the same things, it was definitely much more limited. Also, I found like during the pandemic, when she\\'s socializing with her friends, she\\'s also not considerate with other people. She\\'s constantly yelling on the phone to them. \\n\\n\\tAnd my son, who\\'s a senior at high school is, \"I\\'m trying to study for my APs and she\\'s annoying.\" There you are, go. And I don\\'t know like it\\'s just like she\\'s oblivious to anything else. And we don\\'t need to, we don\\'t want to hear all of the gossip. And I don\\'t know, I hope after the pandemic that better, but I also can see as things are improving, she\\'s also out and about more. [crosstalk 00:34:20].\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, the thing is like I have three children, as well, and one of them has ADHD and my son, I didn\\'t get his full results yet, but I do know he has dyslexia. I don\\'t know if ADHD is on top of it. Like I said, because we were home, I was able to catch it, because I was working so many hours, I didn\\'t see he wasn\\'t reading well. He faked it and he was able to cover it from me. And his sisters would cover him because they would help him with homework.\\n\\n\\tAnd I guess through their frustration, they would do it for him or give him the answers. That helped, even though that was a big fight because he fought with me every day, he didn\\'t want to work. But his reading scores increased, he got better. But the management was so hard for them to keep them off the iPads, the computers because I felt so bad because they don\\'t have the social outside, I didn\\'t want to be the bad mom and say, \"Okay, stop, you can\\'t.\" \\n\\n\\tAnd it just, I didn\\'t have the energy to tell them, to always watch over them because I am still working full-time at home. And so, working full-time then teachers calling me, \"Oh, they don\\'t see him on the screen.\" It was a lot. And then, my husband works at night, he comes, that was an argument in itself because he don\\'t know what to do, so his thing is like, \"Oh, I can\\'t do nothing,\" so he goes, so I\\'m angry at him, so I\\'m yelling every day. \\n\\n\\tAnd so, I wasn\\'t happy any more and my attitude just changed. I just was always upset every day. I was always mad, and always arguing, and so this was how it was for me every day for a while. There\\'s a little change now, but that\\'s because I decided, I don\\'t care. I had to just stop. I was going to lose my mind. That\\'s how it went. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI agree with you there. I got to the point where all I did all day long was scream and scream and scream that I just personally didn\\'t like being in my house myself, so I could only imagine what my kids were going through. And it just got to the point where I gave up with school, I didn\\'t care, so if they went on the electronics from the time they woke up \\'til the time they went to bed, I was done. I\\'m just tired of screaming and being the mean person. It just has been hell. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI mean, it\\'s a period that has affected everyone and at home, us parents, we have tried, like in my case, I\\'ve tried to, like I said before, overcompensate with giving him the free time to be online for as long as he wants, staying up until whenever he gets tired. That has created a problem in my house because I have my daughter who is right next to him and the bed basically is just divided by the one wall. They are separate rooms, but everything that happens in his room, every conversation, every movement, she could hear it. \\n\\n\\tAnd then, that\\'s why we always had a specific sleeping time so that it was good for everyone. Now, that has become a problem because she has to be up at 6:00 and if he stays up until midnight, 1:00 moving around, she is constantly saying, \"Tell him to be quiet, tell him I need to go to sleep. Tell him...\" That has created a problem, but I think in every household, we as parents, we try to overcompensate the fact that they were not interacting with their friends, they\\'re not having physical activity, they\\'re not outside, so we just let them get away with basically just being online or playing games.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI totally agree with what you\\'re saying, Parent 1. And I do try to set a bedtime and make sure my son\\'s in the bed before I go to bed. But he does wake up and every now and then, like I said, I\\'ll wake up like 2:00 in the morning, and I\\'m like, you might hear him in the background now, which is the other thing I wanted to agree with Parent 2 about is, listen, their conversations when they\\'re on these games are, can be outrageous sometimes. And so, my thought now is, he\\'s gotten used to this.\\n\\n\\tWhen they go back to school, is this something that, is this kind of conversation or interactions, are they going to continue in person? Or is this just a gaming thing? Right? Or I\\'m just curious like how is that going to play out? I hope to goodness not. And working in a school with students, I work with all the students with that because a lot of them are on these games and they\\'re talking, oh, the language, sometimes. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOne thing, yeah. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry. And I think also the fact that they are getting so used to relating to everyone through online. When they are together physically, I know for my son, they become more introverted because they\\'re so used to talking to each other through a screen, when they\\'re in person, there\\'s going to be less interaction, less conversation because they\\'re not going to feel as comfortable as they did before. Talking in person as opposed to talking from the comfort of your own private room. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThat\\'s true. Yeah. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'ll say that only one thing that\\'s been an advantage with the friends that the friends have become more of a support system. And that\\'s been a positive. Because my daughter has anxiety. And pre-pandemic, I felt that every time she had homework, I mean not that I had to do it with her, but I had to sit there and she needed me for the confidence. And I wasn\\'t necessarily helping her, I was just wasting my time.\\n\\n\\tAnd now, the friends have taken that role, so that is a positive that she has now a support system with the friends. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI think a negative on the Internet, too, is that these kids have figured out how even though you block certain things, they\\'ve made new accounts and new ways to get into things that it\\'s just to the point where I don\\'t block anything just because I figure at least, even if it\\'s inappropriate, at least I can monitor what it is and then talk to them about why it\\'s not appropriate. Why you shouldn\\'t do things like that, why you shouldn\\'t be on a site like that, what can happen to you. \\n\\n\\tI\\'ve made them more aware of things like that, which is stuff I probably would not have talked to them about in the past. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYep, they\\'ve became pros. [crosstalk 00:42:01].\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nYep. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOr they would, that\\'s the only time they get along. One of the girls distract me because I have the iPhone and screen time and I block their... One of them distract me and the other one, they work good together, and I\\'m like... All of a sudden, I\\'m like, \"I don\\'t remember I gave you permission to download that app.\" And it took me a minute to figure out how they\\'re doing this. And I was like, \"Oh, you all could get along when you all want to do something negative but all other times you are arguing, whatever.\" I said, \"I\\'m going to get you.\" But just the same as you, Parent 5, it was like, every time I would try to come up with a schedule, and you always have someone to tell you, \"Oh, this is what you need to do, because you don\\'t have no control of your kids.\" \\n\\n\\tSo then, I\\'m like, \"Okay, I\\'m going to have control.\" These kids get used to things and they shit, and I\\'m like, \"I\\'m done.\" I don\\'t know what to do anymore. Sleeping early and then one wake up in the middle of the night, \"Oh, I can\\'t sleep.\" And then, all of a sudden, all three of them is in my bed. And then, I have a crook in the neck, it\\'s like they find ways for me to change the rules. Certain things I\\'ve been good at keeping like, \"No, you all not going to switch up on me.\" But many of it has been hard throughout the pandemic to keep consistency. Very difficult. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nIt\\'s so hard, so hard.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt is. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI think the teachers are afraid to call my house anymore because I just break down emotionally to them, because I can\\'t handle it. If I can\\'t handle it at 49 years old with three kids, how am I expecting my three kids at their ages to handle this? \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWell, moving on a little bit to how they use some of their technology during the pandemic. I think rule bending aside, because I think kids definitely do find a way to get us to do that. I know my own children do. How they\\'re always smarter and find some other way of getting... For the longest time during the pandemic, they\\'d wait until, like during the original quarantine, they\\'d wait until I was on the phone and then ask me to by Roblox or whatever it was for their games. But when I was so distracted, like that I would\\'ve given them a million dollars to leave me alone for two seconds. \\n\\n\\tAnd so, certainly what looks like five... And then, I didn\\'t even notice at some point, I had three different monthly subscriptions for Roblox because they\\'d asked me so many times and like I thought I was buying it once, I don\\'t know. It\\'s very confusing. But talking how they use social media and gaming, when I use the word social media I mean also things like YouTube and WhatsApp and other chat option, not necessary just Facebook or Instagram or things like that. Or the hideous TikTok. What were your perceptions or how did your children use that prior to the pandemic, during the pandemic and what are you thinking about in terms of as we return to in person school and in person life, especially in light of the CDC\\'s guidelines today, what do you think will be some of your concerns about it? \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWell, I mean, a 13 year old daughter, and I don\\'t know if it\\'s pandemic-related or not, I think it\\'s been awful. Because with the TikTok she can tell who\\'s at who\\'s house. And she can tell when she\\'s left out. And she calls somebody and the person says, \"I can\\'t see you, I\\'m doing something with my mom.\" And then, an hour later, the person\\'s doing a TikTok with somebody else. And she also has something-\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:46:10] not at you, but because I have a 13 year old daughter. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, then the other part, I don\\'t know if it\\'s Instagram or one of those, she sees the little icons of people. She\\'s like, \"Okay, Parent 2, Friend 1 told me she\\'s busy today and she forgot.\" I guarantee you, [crosstalk 00:46:28].\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThat might be house party. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOr Snapchat, they can find their locations, yeah.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nRight, if Parent 2, Friend 1 goes here, I know she\\'s with Parent 2, Friend 2. If Parent 2, Friend 1 goes here, I know she\\'s with Parent 2, Friend 3, which means she lied to me. And sure enough, Parent 2, Friend 1 went to Parent 2, Friend 2\\'s. And it\\'s so much social drama that we did not have. If somebody went out on a Friday night with friends, Monday morning, I don\\'t think it even came up. And the kids are stupid, too, because they\\'re lying about to their friends, and their friends know they\\'re lying. And then, the friends get mad at them and then they\\'re like, \"Oh, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.\" But I\\'m like but the other day, her friend was asking her, \"Oh, you went to a picnic with these girls?\" And she was asking like accusingly. \\n\\n\\tAnd I\\'m in the background, my daughter was going to kill me, I\\'m like, \"Oh, like when you were in Florida and you blew my daughter off?\" I\\'m living through this drama and it\\'s not... it\\'s this media. It\\'s terrible. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah, my daughter is 20 now, but even before this, because like I said, she\\'s 20. Throughout those whole teenage years, some of the same things were still coming up. They weren\\'t on Instagram, Facebook, they were on other sites. And I would say at least for me, it didn\\'t slow down until she turned 18. And that\\'s when things began to kind of like mellow out. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nDon\\'t tell me that. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nWas that when she graduated high school? \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. [crosstalk 00:48:17].\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nFive more years of this is what you\\'re saying?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSorry. [crosstalk 00:48:22].\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nYeah, mines is 14. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt\\'s a lot of drama, and I just did a whole workshop with my students who are 11. Some of them are 12, on just that, social media and drama. Because every time I have these sessions with some of my... it\\'s particularly with the girls. It\\'s always about who\\'s saying what to who. And now, they\\'re even taking pictures and sending pictures of other friends to other people and it\\'s just and it\\'s like guys you can\\'t. It\\'s not even legal, I don\\'t think.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThey do that. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nBut you know, they see it on TV. Everybody, if something happens, everybody\\'s quick to pull their cameras out. Nobody\\'s quick to step in, it\\'s just oh, pull your camera out and record it, so you could post it. That\\'s all they want to do is get other people in trouble now. But that\\'s [crosstalk 00:49:15].\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd then, send it to somebody else to say, \"So and so was talking about you.\" Screenshot!\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYep, they do. [crosstalk 00:49:29].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI always tell my son, \"Anything you type-\"\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nDon\\'t say anything you don\\'t want it to be [crosstalk 00:49:34].\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nAnd just for anyone to take a screenshot like Parent 2 said and then send it around. And the one person that you didn\\'t want to see it, it\\'s going to get to that person, so just make sure you don\\'t type anything. Even if you delete it, don\\'t send anything that you don\\'t want to get you in trouble. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThat\\'s pretty much. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nI have a funny story. My daughter comes into my bedroom one, it\\'s like a Saturday night at like 1:00 in the morning and she\\'s like, \"Dad, I have to talk to you about something.\" And I was like, \"Oh, my God, what?\" And it turns out she\\'d been on the phone with her friends and this guy who she described as this guy was another 13 year old was texting them that if they don\\'t do something then he\\'s going to hack their phones and he\\'s going to do all this other stuff to them. And so, I picked up her phone and I was like, \"Oh, what\\'s his phone number.\" And she read the number and I called him. \\n\\n\\tShe\\'s like, \"You\\'re a sociopath.\" And I\\'m like, \"Why? Because I called?\" I got this kid on the phone, I was like, \"Hi, you\\'re threatening my daughter, you want to stop?\" And he was like, \"Oh, I couldn\\'t see her phone, it was her friends who were sending these screenshots of what she was writing the whole time.\" \\n\\n\\tAnd so, I sat my daughter down and I was like, \"Listen, I\\'m just going to tell you, if international spies, the US can\\'t get Apple to unlock their phones to read their text messages, I don\\'t think some kid in Brooklyn is getting yours. But also, if you just call people, like this is why you shouldn\\'t text someone anything you wouldn\\'t want to screenshot and send to everyone they know.\" \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s just a funny story. But what do you think would be problematic as they go back to school? \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:51:37] be able to put down. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nIn person, relationships that they will be having, I don\\'t think they\\'re going to feel as comfortable talking in person. At least, in the beginning, as they do now behind a screen from the comfort of their house, they feel protected from their rooms, so they feel like they can say anything and it\\'s not going to go anywhere because when they don\\'t want to see it, when they don\\'t want to hear it, they just turn it off. \\n\\n\\tBut when you\\'re in person, with the other person in front of you, I think that\\'s actually going to, a lot of the kids are just going to become, are either going to be too shy or too introverted. I think it\\'s going to take them some time to adjust back to how it was before, before he pandemic. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:52:30] the opposite. He\\'s so introverted, since she\\'s been home, she\\'s not like this. She\\'s normally out, bubbly, she enjoys everything she can. She joins this, I feel more like her chauffeur after school. She\\'s into everything. Here, she\\'s in the house, she never leaves her room. It drives me nuts. Drives me, she can\\'t... go back to see people and human beings. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAnd I notice students even in the class now, though, those who are in the building, they\\'re still texting each other. It\\'s going to be interesting to see how classrooms are going to be run. Because some teachers are saying they still want to use technology, as we\\'re talking about reopening, and is that still going to limit that socialization? Because then, they sit there on the WhatsApp and chat with each other even though they\\'re sitting in the same room. And yes, they\\'re at separate desks, but they just they chat that way. [crosstalk 00:53:25].\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI think my concern is like it\\'s not so much as that. I think for the social part, over the years, they\\'ll come back. It may not be as how we grew up, it is going to look different. No matter what, because there was social media from the get go, there was already issues with social interactions, I think. \\n\\n\\tThis has just made it worse, but I think it was going to be like this no matter what. But what I do believe is going to happen, what I have received from this is my older daughter, she was able to kind of see what is due, what\\'s not due. I felt that having it on the computer and being able to visually see it, also with me knowing what they were learning, it helped me to kind of know how I can help them. Because the other way with the paper and allowing the kids to write it, it was so hard for me to connect. \\n\\n\\tThere was a flexibility of learning so that my children could kind of do the work where they can, you know, oh, I\\'ll catch up when the, after school. That flexibility helped them to give their best when they can. And so, going back, I think they\\'re going to lose that. That is what I see would be a issue. But with the social media, I had social media issues before the pandemic, during, it\\'s going [inaudible 00:55:00] from my household. Especially, with the girls. Especially, the girls. \\n\\n\\tBut I do like the computer but for me, I realize I know what all my children was doing before I\\'d have access to that information unless I went to school and the teacher told me. And I\\'m a visual person, because even if they tell me, it\\'s not clicking. Whereas, when I was able to go on the computer and I see, okay, oh, that\\'s what they\\'re doing. How are they doing it? It helped me to know, okay, you know what? I can\\'t teach you that, you need a tutor or I would find ways to help them so they could get better help. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nAll right, does anyone have any other thoughts they\\'d like to share around this? \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nYeah, I just want to say that I think socially, it\\'s going to get worse. Because, but now they\\'re out and about, there\\'s going to be more evidence of being left out. All of a sudden, now we\\'re going to be back to, \"Are you wearing the right outfit? Are you wearing this?\" And like, all the stuff that the one good thing was getting dressed was not an issue. She literally went to school at her computer and she would wear her pajamas or sweats and the whole stuff is going to start up again. I don\\'t know. It\\'s just I don\\'t see it getting better. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWhat do you think would change the outcome? \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt\\'s going to be a problem. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nMy camera was interrupted, so I just heard the last part where you said the clothing. Did you say they were not dressing up during the pandemic. And then, I know that\\'s another thing that I personally also think of. Being at home, it\\'s all sweatpants and pajamas all day. But going back to school, that they need to wear uniforms where my son goes to school, so that in itself it\\'s work, extra work for me. Washing the uniforms, ironing the uniforms on a daily basis. \\n\\n\\tI don\\'t mind if it gives him a positive outcome. But when it comes to also, yeah, dressing, that has taken a turn, as well with the way they feel comfortable now. Even when we go anywhere, he only wants to dress the same way as he dresses at home. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI agree, too. My son will run around in pajamas all day, every day, and even when it\\'s, \"Oh, run the trash out.\" He\\'s running out in his pajamas. I do think it is going to be a process of going back for all of us. Workers, teachers, students, and one of the things I know that we talk a lot about at school is spending just those first couple months, just getting kids acclimated to just being back and socializing again and doing whether it\\'s the circles and getting to know you activities and just different things like that and not, even though they are behind, there is some lag in terms of the academics, but catching up on that after we get them socialized first.\\n\\n\\tAnd not just the students, like I said, but also the parents and having workshops and things with parents and also for teachers. I know for us, for at least our school, we refer tons of families to you guys. And then, we try to look at some of the workshops and things that whether it\\'s Child Mind or Healthy Brain offer and put that out there. Because that\\'s what we\\'re going to need, just a lot of that SEL support. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI know that I also feel the same. My son went through all the studies about three years ago through the Healthy Network. And I wanted to call and see what else is offered in terms of getting help for him in terms of being in turn that the pandemic has the impact on his emotions emotionally, mentally and even physically. Because, spending so much time in a room on a bed, he\\'s not even sitting on a desk. Everything is done from the bed only because of the comfort. Oh, I\\'m sitting here, my legs are straight, so there\\'s no need for me to sit up on a chair. \\n\\n\\tThe interaction, the emotional, mental, so I actually wanted to know if there\\'s anything else that is offered just so that we can get the information.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nIt\\'s very funny that both you and Parent 4 brought that up, because that\\'s literally the reason why we\\'re running these focus groups. Even though we\\'re talking about problematic Internet usage, we\\'ve been running multiple focus groups. We actually, and tomorrow, we\\'re just basically collecting information from you guys just about your experiences with your children and just how they\\'ve been navigating the Internet, what problems you guys have seen so that way we\\'re able to supply you guys with just a host of different resources and things like that that will be helpful to you guys. And that\\'s going to be through the form of a town hall meeting in late May/early June. \\n\\n\\tYou guys hit it right on the nail. If any of the other parents want to just, what ways in which, like what are some ways in which we at the Healthy Brain Network can figure out just different resources we can supply you guys with and different ways in which we can assist you guys with any of the difficulties you\\'ve been facing throughout the pandemic. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWell, one thing that I\\'m interested in, because she\\'s been doing her school from home and the tests have been from home, her whole test anxiety of walking into the room, sitting down at the desk, having the you know, hasn\\'t happened this year because... and math, that a lot of times she has this one on her lap. \\n\\n\\tI\\'m concerned when she goes back and she\\'s in eighth grade and it\\'s going to be more demanding and she still has test anxiety. And so, anything that you can provide to help with that transition back to school and all the anxiety of more formalized learning would be great. \\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nTo me, the number one concern would be social anxiety. The way, like I said, the turn that the pandemic has, or the impact on the way I see, it\\'s next door to you. That to me would be one of the major things and something I would like to get some type of help on the social anxiety. \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAnd then, you guys can also in addition to just like any anxieties around school and just social interactions, so today\\'s group was about social media and just what we call here problematic Internet usage, I don\\'t know if we coined the term, but that\\'s just what we refer to it as. All the concerns that you guys have expressed are concerns that we are seeing consistently with every single group. \\n\\n\\tWhat ways can we support you guys just with Internet usage, just like resources for school, any anxieties, any... We\\'ve heard like Moderator 2 and I have heard things about different messaging, like services or resources that schools have been encouraging kids to use and how that\\'s become problematic. Just like what can we touch on for you guys\\' anxiety, exactly. Is it like...? \\n\\n\\tWe\\'ve also heard things about social media influencers and how that\\'s on TikTok and how that\\'s just drastically changed the ways in which kids are behaving and what they\\'re interested in now and how that helps them with their anxiety and all these different things. Anything that you guys can supply us with, whether it\\'s with Internet usage, school, anything with any mental disorders that you... as your children may be facing. Any problems of that matter, just please let us know how we can support you guys on that. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI would definitely think you need some more counseling and cyberbullying because like Parent 2 was saying earlier, these kids don\\'t understand how they\\'re bullying and playing mental games with other kids because the way they talk or the way they lie to each other and now we can find out a lot of access. Because it really is something that\\'s hitting everybody, whether it\\'s boys or girls, because I have both and it hits them both. And mentally, because like I said, emotionally, my son is in counseling in school and he never needed it. Now he needs it because just the transition back into school was like, \"I want to stay home.\" And he\\'s a straight A student that was failing.\\n\\n\\tAnd now that he\\'s back at school, he\\'s passing and like I said, the teachers called me up and I cry to them because I don\\'t know what to do. I can\\'t sit down and do his work for him. You know? But this is really, I mean, listen, you got people to help us with mental and emotional, I\\'m onboard. I got three, I\\'m onboard. And parents will take it, too. It\\'s tough.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThat was one of the things that I was struggling with for my middle daughter, Parent 3, Child 2. I just, I needed someone, and then she needed counseling. And even before the pandemic, it\\'s like it was hard to get a program for her for several reasons. If they were near my home, they won\\'t take my insurance. And those that are far, I have to work so I would have to take days off to go to her sessions. \\n\\n\\tEven right now, even through the pandemic, I was like, \"Okay, I heard they were doing a lot of these online.\" I said, \"That\\'s great, I could put her on.\" I couldn\\'t get through and I\\'m like, \"What is it that I\\'m doing wrong?\" And it\\'s like for children, it was like so it\\'s too hard to get them counseling or for her, I wanted her to do CBTs and to be able to get her medication that her doctors don\\'t want to give it to her. \\n\\n\\tI had to stop giving it to her because it was just getting messy. And those are the things I\\'m struggling with. And the ones that do have the time, they don\\'t take my insurance so it takes boku of money that I don\\'t have to pay for it. That has been my biggest challenge. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nParent 3, [crosstalk 01:07:18].\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOh, okay. I was just saying, is there any way that some of the things that you all offer can be brought into the school in some cases? Because I know sometimes with our family, it\\'s just hard to maybe get there, or they can or if maybe there\\'s, I don\\'t know. If there\\'s some kind of liaison or something who can actually, physically once we are in, could be there to help. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThere\\'s not a lot available. There really is not a lot available. I know in Staten Island, they have the Jewish Board. You have to wait months for an appointment. They make an appointment and that\\'s just to kind of evaluate you. And then, they\\'ll call you when they have somebody available. I\\'m still on the list from like two years. And my son has been to two or three counselors privately with my insurance and it gets crazy expensive and honestly, useless. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nAnd see, it\\'s to your guys\\' point, it\\'s very expensive. But I can\\'t even find anyone. Because of the pandemic, everybody who people recommend, is booked. Booked, booked, booked. And then, the one guy is like, \"Oh, well maybe in six weeks.\" I\\'m like, \"But in six weeks, it\\'s summer.\" And he\\'s like, \"Yeah, well, maybe that\\'s not a good time for her to start since a lot of her anxiety is test anxiety and school anxiety, so maybe during the summer it wouldn\\'t be a good time.\" And I\\'m like, \"I just want at this point, to have someone lined up for August for her to start with.\" \\n\\n\\tBecause, she\\'s taking medication and she\\'s like, \"What is this medication doing?\" Because, she\\'s still full of anxiety, she\\'s picking at her feet. And no one is available. I mean-\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nNo one. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\n[inaudible 01:09:09].\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI can\\'t even get my daughter to get her medication again, that\\'s how bad it is. She\\'s suffering, and I don\\'t know how to help her. And I know it\\'s going to make her... It\\'s creating other things like depression and anxiety that it\\'s so unfair. And I even told her doctor. Her doctor was like, \"Well, I\\'m not a psychiatrist, so I don\\'t want to offer it.\" And it\\'s hard. Everybody wants money only, when it comes to these kids. Because if they see some money making things, so everybody just, \"Oh, I\\'m not going to give this for free.\" I could find free for my age, but not for the children. I don\\'t know. \\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nEspecially, with the medication. You are right. You have to like pay for $350 session where they don\\'t do anything, so [crosstalk 01:10:08] fill the prescription for you. I mean, it\\'s such a waste. That\\'s a psychiatrist, not the therapist. That\\'s just someone who has the ability to write the prescription.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThey won\\'t talk to you for more than five minutes.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nExactly. And they\\'ll charge you and if you don\\'t talk to them, you don\\'t get the prescription. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nWell, we have to close, wrap-up for today. What I was going to say is we\\'re going to see if the town hall and what services, what we end up offering after, say I would encourage all of you to keep watch and we\\'ll keep in touch with you based on what we find and what we recommend. But if you have any questions, you can always email myself or Administrator and we can help you a little bit further. Administrator, do you want to explain compensation, then we\\'ll wrap up? \\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAbsolutely. Once again, just thank you guys so much for all of the information that you guys provided us with today. It was really impactful, especially the last couple of minutes. This was the first group in which we\\'ve actually have parents kind of list ways in which we can provide them with services. Once we do or like just resources once we do have the town hall meeting, so thank you guys so much for that, it really means a lot to us.\\n\\n\\tIn regards to compensation, you should receive it no later than Thursday. It comes via email. It\\'s an Amazon gift card. If you do not receive an email from Amazon that says, \"Healthy Brain Network,\" or \"Child Mind Institute,\" by Thursday, please do not hesitate to email me or give me a call. But yeah, you guys should honestly receive it before Thursday, if anything. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nJust a quick question about the town hall meeting. Will we be able to submit questions prior to it so that they could be like some of the other town halls from the schools and stuff, that they usually say, \"Oh, we\\'re going to have a meeting, you can submit some questions that we\\'ll address during the meeting?\"\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\n[crosstalk 01:12:08]. Yes. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nSure, you could email your question and I will try to have it addressed.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAbsolutely, yeah. We haven\\'t really figured out the formatting of the town hall besides the fact that it will be on Zoom, but if you guys have any questions that you want us to definitely kind of what\\'s the word? I\\'m so sorry, my brain is just... Any questions that you want us to address, just please, do not hesitate to email me or give me a call. I will take everything and we can all collect it. And then, you bring that up, I might even reach out to the rest of the parents who have done their focus groups and ask them if they have any questions that they would want us to address, as well, so thank you for that. \\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nThank you. I really appreciate everything you guys do. You are a help. \\n\\nModerator 2:\\n\\nThank you so much. And thank you all for sharing.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you for having us. \\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nThank you so much.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you, have a good day, guys. \\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nHave a good day. Bye-bye.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nThank you, good night.'b'Parent 1:\\n\\nI\\'ll go first I guess. My name is Parent 1. I have four children. Child 1 is 22. He\\'s in the autistic spectrum. Child 2 is 21, Child 3 is 18, and Child 4 is 15. And today I\\'m here to discuss mostly about Child 3. And my favorite show lately is Supernatural. I watch binge-watch it with my daughter. So it\\'s fun.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nSounds like fun.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nOkay, I guess I\\'ll go next. Hi everyone. My name is Parent 2. I also have four children. The oldest is 36. The one that follows is 26, 25.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nSo sorry, I just saw that you joined. I just wanted to make sure that everybody was in the group. Sorry guys.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s okay. And then the last one is Child 3, who is 16, who was diagnosed with ADD and a cognitive disorder. And that\\'s who I\\'m here for. My favorite show, I don\\'t know if anybody can believe, but it\\'s General Hospital. That\\'s a go-to. I recorded every day for the past, like 40 years. So that\\'s it for me.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nI guess I can go next. My name is Parent 3. I\\'m 48. I have one daughter, Child 1. She is 16 and she has ADD and a lot of physical health problems. Chronic illnesses.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nOh, your show. What show do you watch?\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nOh, well I like the Real Housewives of anything.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nOkay. Someone else want to take us? Parent 4? You were-\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nSure. Yeah. Sorry. What happened to my picture? Sorry. Oh, there.\\n\\n\\tHi. I\\'m Parent 4. I have two children. Both of who have gone through the HBN studies. So I\\'m not really sure which one I\\'m here for today. I believe it\\'s probably Child 1 because he\\'s the older one and is much more technologically problematic, is the way I would say it, but also savvy. And I just finished watching the Woody Allen Farrow documentary, which was kind of a downer. And now I\\'m watching something even more depressing, Mare of Easttown, I think it\\'s called. Anyway, that\\'s what I\\'m watching.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nHello? Can you hear me?\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nYep. I can hear you.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nSorry. Trying to figure out how to work this out. Hi, I\\'m Parent 5. I have three children. I believe I\\'m here for my oldest who is eight going on 40. I don\\'t know exactly what he\\'s diagnosed with yet because we are having him tested. So I believe that\\'s why I\\'m here.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nDid you need my favorite do you need my favorite show?\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nMy favorite show is Mayans. I\\'m a big motorcycle person.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nOkay. Parent 6?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nCan you hear me?\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSo my name is Parent 6. I have three sons and I have three stepsons. And I am here for my son, Child 1, who has had multiple brain surgeries. He has brain tumors, which has caused cognitive delays.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nOkay, well, we\\'ll get started and move pretty quickly today so we can finish in time. I like to do this exercise just so can understand a little bit about where we each come from, what\\'s going on with our children, and their use of technology. I like to get a lot of different opinions and just different thoughts. If you can just jot down on a piece of paper or a note, whatever is handy, three positives about your child using technology during the pandemic and three negatives. And circle the most important one on each. And we\\'ll share those.\\n\\n\\tAnd whenever you\\'re done, you can just shout out and let me know and we\\'ll talk through some of them.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nOkay, I\\'ll go again. Which I forgot to say about Child 3 who\\'s the one I\\'m speaking most about today, is diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and stuff like that. He\\'s 18, like I said. I am thinking of having him reevaluated because I honestly think he may be on the spectrum due to some of his behaviors. But anyway, so what I wrote down is positive is that he can stay in touch with his friends, he can play games, use his brain a bit, and have schoolwork. Negatively is that he\\'s constantly on his device. Really doesn\\'t want to leave the house much at all anymore.\\n\\n\\tAnd the worst was over the summer last year he, I guess, I don\\'t know if it was from being on the computer or his phone, but he almost had a breakdown or I honestly thought we were going to have to admit him to a hospital because he became obsessed with thinking that he was cursed. He was watching these videos with people would say, \"If you see this doll or you look at this thing, you\\'re going to be cursed.\"\\n\\n\\tHe\\'s always had issues, but this was, I mean, honestly, very bizarre for him to be out there with that. We had to get him psychiatric help. And he started taking medication. And now he sees a therapist and a psychiatrist and it just, like I said, he always had issues, but I think the whole Corona being stuck in the house and by being on, therefore then, the computer and his phone so much, I don\\'t know what it did to his mental state. I mean, really had a bad effect.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nThank you. Does anyone else want to share?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYes, actually, that really resonated with me. I can say some of the positives, but then I want to segue into what she was talking about because I found some of the same things. So Child 1 is my youngest of the six boys we have. So he was here by himself because he has health issues, so exposing him to COVID was a real concern. But one of the positives of the computer was that he could at least talk to people that were his age. He had something to fill the time, because filling all those hours was nerve-wracking for me. And sometimes you would hear him laugh and stuff, that would you bring joy.\\n\\n\\tBut the thing that happened with Child 1 that we had never seen before was that he also became obsessed that there were vampires and that they were going to come get him. And all of the same things that, I forget the woman\\'s name that was before me, I apologize. But we saw some of the same things and I was so scared. I took all the technology away from him and he got better. So I don\\'t know what that is online. And I\\'m an older mom, so I don\\'t know as much about technology and what they\\'re doing, but it was really concerning for me and scary.\\n\\n\\tAnd then at the same time, you feel bad because then they\\'re depressed that they don\\'t have anybody, that they don\\'t have anyone to talk to. So that was my input, but it was interesting that I heard somebody say the same things that we dealt with during COVID.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nDoes anyone else want to share quickly?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI can share it. I\\'m going to make a connection to what both of them said, because my son didn\\'t really have anything specific that he brought out, but he was having nightmares and was afraid to sleep alone. So I\\'m wondering if it may have been something that he came across online. But to give you his positive and negatives, which some of which the positives are actually negatives as well. So he\\'s very savvy, technologically savvy. So that for me was good because I didn\\'t need to help him too much. I didn\\'t have to interfere too much with that. He\\'s very creative. So sometimes when he gets online, he does really creative things. And I thought sometimes it was good for occupying him, just get him out of my hair. I\\'m trying to work remote and he\\'s here. So that was good.\\n\\n\\tThe negatives were he\\'s a little too savvy that he can be a little sneaky and a little manipulative with it. And I wouldn\\'t know, because I\\'m not as savvy as he is. He gets easily frustrated. So if he\\'s playing a game and he\\'s not winning or it\\'s not going the way he wants, he\\'ll start banging things and hitting the computer as if it\\'s the computer\\'s fault. And again, the other is too much time. Spent too much time on it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nAll right. Moving on to some of our questions for today. In the first question, I would like you to think about the time prior to the pandemic and what your child\\'s use of technology for education looked like then. Was it beneficial? Was it already problematic? Did you already have concerns? Did they not even use it?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWell, I can start with that. Child 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problem was a problem. The only thing he\\'s not very good at because of his cognitive disorder, he\\'s unable to retain any information. So his worst subject was math. I think after a while, once he learned about the calculator, he was just cheating his way through math, which became more of a problem. Now, he\\'s homeschooled and he just seems to use the modern tech, he Googles everything instead of learning. It becomes harder for me because unfortunately I\\'m in the medical fields. So I\\'m not able to work from home. I\\'m not home with him. So he\\'s basically alone most of the day. But that\\'s how it all started before the pandemic. Now with the pandemic, it just became worse because now he\\'s again, Googling everything, using the computers. So he\\'s not really learning much. That\\'s all I have.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nDoes anyone else have thoughts or agree, disagree, different?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI can tell you a little bit about technology that Child 1 is using.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSo at Child 1\\'s school, every student has an iPad that they take back and forth to school. And they use it pretty much exclusively. They don\\'t really have books. So I found that that was really great, but to just have the computer to do all of the ... and I\\'m a retired teacher, so I do have some educational background, but to do all of his schoolwork through the computer screen and have a cognitive delay, it\\'s not beneficial. He didn\\'t learn what he needed to be. But I understand it\\'s also the circumstances we\\'re in. But I do believe that Child 1 and probably many other kids lost this year of educational growth. I don\\'t know if that was your question, but that was my thought.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nIs anyone else have feedback to that? Because the next question was, what was it like during the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nFrustrating. Very frustrating. Child 1 withdrew a lot, lost friends. Child 1 is not very social. So the couple of friends that he did have, they just kind of separated. I started to see less and less of Child 1. I mean, we live in a really big house, three floors and there was days where I would come home from work and he wouldn\\'t even come out of his room, not at all unless I went in. And when I did go in, he was very agitated. And I just came back from vacation and I guess a week away from me, past two days, we\\'ve been closer. I don\\'t know how long that\\'s going to last. But with the pandemic, he has definitely become very withdrawn.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nOkay. What are some of all of your concerns with returning to school, in person school and their use of technology? What are your feelings around that? What are you worried about?\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI\\'ll say Child 3, he graduated from high school last June. So he started, it\\'s kind of back to the other question and this one. He started college last fall, which he did. And then he signed up for this semester and he just got so overwhelmed with having to do the computer. He dropped out and he withdrew without us even knowing. And it was at a point where no refunds. He was also getting an excelsior scholarship, which now he will not be able to get anymore. So I don\\'t really know what he\\'s ... at this point, we\\'re trying to figure out what he\\'s going to do.\\n\\n\\tI have my daughter as well, she goes to college. She has a couple of classes in person. She does really well though, she loves school. My younger daughter, high school. They\\'re the worst program there right now, because whether you\\'re blended or virtual, everything is virtual. So the kids that go into class go in, but with their computer and a headset and teachers are at home. But I do believe even for my daughter who has no issues, she will be a junior next year and it will be very difficult. Anxiety is starting already to have to go back, even though she\\'s sick of being home.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nAnd I feel like we haven\\'t really finished with COVID. So even my son who goes to school two days a week, says that he sits in front of a computer at school with headphones. And some teachers who are there will come into the room. The technology has been both a blessing and a curse because yeah, it allowed them to go to school while they couldn\\'t physically. But now that they\\'re physically in school, I feel like technology is going to play an even more important role for them that I don\\'t want. I think it\\'s really important that they continue learning through a physical means like a teacher. I know technology is a big subject now too. Technology wasn\\'t a subject when I was a kid, but it\\'s huge now.\\n\\n\\tBut I just hope that they can find a way to really use it to the best of the ability and not just have kids get on it and do what they need to do. Even here at home, you had mentioned the other thing about technology at home and the difference between going back in school and stuff. And I\\'m actually really shocked that he\\'s able to view YouTube on his school computer. They don\\'t really put too many firewalls up for a lot of things that I would\\'ve thought. So while he\\'s in class, if I\\'m not monitoring, he\\'s got another window open watching stupid YouTube videos, which I hope he\\'s not doing at school.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nI caught my boys doing that too. Not only that, but on their school laptop, they figured out a way to record and have a YouTube channel and make videos and post them. And I thought I was pretty tech savvy.\\n\\n\\tWell, moving on to their use of social media. And when I say social media, I don\\'t only mean Instagram, Facebook, or probably the actual social media that kids use these days, because those are the two I know. I also mean YouTube, other chat apps, WhatsApp, things like that. So thinking about those kinds of programs and apps, how did your child use social media or those apps prior to the pandemic? And what were your thoughts around it? Was it beneficial then? And we\\'re going to go through the same question. So I want to hear about prior to the pandemic, during the pandemic, and your concerns for them in returning to in-person school.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI can speak to that. I don\\'t know if you want certain people to speak at certain times.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nEveryone. I want to hear everyone.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nSo Child 1 has been vaccinated and at his school, all of the teachers who want to get vaccinated have been vaccinated and they are back in school. They\\'ve always had iPads, so they still use them. I think that being back in school has really helped him. I found during the pandemic, before the pandemic, he\\'d used social media, which the kids use TikTok a lot. At least that\\'s what I see and Snapchat. And he was using it. But then when I saw during the pandemic, he was using it a lot and using it inappropriately at times, or with people that I didn\\'t want him to be chatting with. So I just used every parent blocking mechanism and I monitored it and he only gets it for a limited amount of time now.\\n\\n\\tAnd on his iPad, he does do that same thing with the YouTube thing. I\\'ve kind of let it go because I just can\\'t fight every fight. But I\\'ve seen him do that when he\\'s talking to his teachers. I do think it\\'s better that they\\'re back in school. School\\'s not exactly the same. They are wearing masks, of course, and they\\'re trying to social distance, and they have a lot of restrictions. But maybe some of it just is that you get to see people. I know that when I got to see people again, it makes you happy. Being isolated at home with just your mom is not fun. Did that answer it? Sometimes I wonder if I\\'m not exactly answering your question.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nYou got it.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI agree with what Child 1\\'s mom said. I found that prior pandemic, my son would play just like video games with his friends. And then when the pandemic hit, it just exploded into like this world of social media and video games. And I didn\\'t let my kids really reach out and use the WhatsApp or Messenger as much, because I was afraid that they might come in contact with people I don\\'t know and I can\\'t stop ... I have three of them, so I can\\'t control all three of them. But I definitely agree with what Child 1\\'s mom said that it\\'s too much out of control. And even if I try to limit his time, it\\'s like I can\\'t tame the beast.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThing is that you feel kind of guilty and we try to tame it because what other activities do they have? They\\'re not going outside. I have not been able to vaccinate Child 1 yet. So I\\'m kind of iffy with him going out and being around other kids. It\\'s like a no-win situation. You take it away from them, what else are they going to do?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah, I understand.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nMy son knows all of the social media things out there, Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, all of these, YouTube. He\\'s asked for a Facebook account, which we won\\'t let him have. The good thing about him is that he actually gets easily bored with them after a while. And then he doesn\\'t want to do them anymore. And he\\'ll move on to the next one, try that one out for a little bit, and then move on to the next one.\\n\\n\\tBefore school, before COVID, he had a lot more activities going on. So he didn\\'t have as much time on his devices. Now, even he goes to school, but he\\'s home by 2:30 and back on his a devices now. And just playing video games and mostly watching YouTube. He wants to create a YouTube channel. So with that, I\\'m making him take a YouTube class about what\\'s good about what you can do on YouTube and what\\'s good and what you shouldn\\'t be doing. So it\\'s sort of like YouTube etiquette. So, I\\'m trying to compromise with him but also still [inaudible 00:23:46] be aware that he needs to still behave. Because he has gotten in trouble at school because of technology. So I just want to make sure that we armed them with the right tools to use technology properly if he\\'s going to use it, which I can\\'t stop him from doing.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nWhat are some of your other thoughts around it?\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nSorry, guys.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s okay.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nWere you speaking to me? I don\\'t know what the question was.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nI just wanted to know what anyone else\\'s thoughts were around your child\\'s use of social media.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nIt\\'s way too much. It\\'s just a lot.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nPrior to, and during, and after. That was my question.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI think my son was like excited about it at first. And then it just kind of lost the novelty. Now he does other things. I mean, he\\'s still on devices, but he just finds new things all the time to kind of get obsessed with.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nWhat part of that feels problematic for you?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nIt\\'s hard for me to keep up with what he\\'s doing. We\\'ve also put a lot of parental controls on it. My husband\\'s a software engineer, so he\\'s a lot better about it than I am. That takes up more of my time now because I do try and check their phones every night after they\\'ve gone to bed, make sure there\\'s nothing horrible on there. And part of that is also monitoring what their friends say too in their messages and in their chats and stuff. So it\\'s a lot of work on us as well that we didn\\'t have before.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nWait, can you guys hear me? Sorry. I\\'m on two different devices at once, but I did have a quick question. And my question was ... sorry. I\\'m just going to lower myself on the second device. My other question was for parents whose children have just different disorders that they may be facing, how has the problematic internet usage or the problematic social media usage influenced that? For example, we\\'ve heard from other parents whose children have anxiety, how looking at pictures of people on Instagram, the way that they are living, social media influencers, like on YouTube and things like that, how that has increased the amount of anxiety that the child may be facing.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI don\\'t really understand what you mean.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nYour child has been diagnosed with a specific disorder. How do you think that disorder has impacted their use of devices during the pandemic?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nI can speak to that.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\n[crosstalk 00:26:56] things helpful. Some people found it more harmful. So for example, a child with ADHD might struggle more with 10,000 apps being able to be open on their device. And someone with anxiety might struggle less because they are able to, I don\\'t know, use the coloring book app to relax.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nI\\'m sorry. I don\\'t know what it is. I\\'ve seen that no matter what disorder they have, for some reason they are geniuses that can handle whatever the internet throws their way. I swear because Child 1 cannot remember his left from his right sometimes, but he sure can remember every app, every song. It\\'s crazy. I don\\'t understand it.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nTrue. It\\'s true.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nThat\\'s very funny.\\n\\nParent 1:\\n\\nI mean, I\\'ll say, I think with both of my boys, my one son he\\'s autistic. He has sensory disorder. I mean, he\\'s high functioning. He has anxiety, he has auditory processing, a whole bunch of different stuff. But he manages. And before the pandemic, he had his routine of what he did and it was good. He always has to have a schedule and know what he\\'s doing. He\\'ll do anything but as long as he knows it\\'s something coming up, if not, he gets thrown by that. So the whole COVID, the restrictions just made it more difficult for him to figure out what to do with his time. They had all kinds of Zoom classes or sessions. He goes to the [program]. He does Respite Hab. And at that point, that was all he was doing.\\n\\n\\tAnd he doesn\\'t like Zoom. He\\'s very overwhelmed by Zoom. You know how people, even you can see when you go on these meetings. Even me, for instance, I was on another meeting yesterday and I couldn\\'t figure out how to mute myself and my dog wouldn\\'t stop barking. So there are things in the background that he just really won\\'t do any of them.\\n\\n\\tHis dayhab, thank God, it\\'s a small one. He went back at the end of August. And except for a few days here and there closing down, they\\'ve been open the whole time. So for him, that\\'s great. And then my son, Child 3, who has his other issues, being on social media, I mean, he\\'s always been on it a lot before. And during it just became his only thing. He didn\\'t see any friends in person because he was afraid. And I think that\\'s what made him constantly watching these things that were scary and made him afraid. Like Child 1\\'s mom. I mean, not that it\\'s good to hear that about someone else, but it at least kind of makes you feel like he wasn\\'t the only one because it was the scariest thing ever to just watch him go through that. He didn\\'t sleep, he didn\\'t eat. He just was panicked all the time, saying \"I just can\\'t take it anymore.\"\\n\\n\\tAnd I think that\\'s what did it to him, going on these sites that he just became addicted to. And moving forward, now he goes out a little bit, he gets together. He\\'s not an overly friendly person, doesn\\'t have that many friends to begin with. So, I\\'m hopeful that the summer, he\\'ll be out more. And I don\\'t know, will move more to the outdoors than the indoors.\\n\\nParent 5:\\n\\nI kind of agree with all the other parents. Prior to COVID, I kept my son Child 1, very sheltered. I feel like social media has made him aware and very angry, with all the new technology, because like I said, he\\'s eight going on 40. His mind\\'s like a sponge. So it\\'s made him very aware of the world that I\\'ve sheltered him from. And very angry and scared and very worried and panicky. I don\\'t know if that\\'s a thing, because I\\'m still learning everything that he\\'s being diagnosed with. So it makes him very panicky.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nDoes anyone else have any thoughts?\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nI think to answer the question a little more directly, she was talking about the influencers and watching these YouTube videos or TikTok things. And both my children were a little obsessed with them to the point they were trying things out like these people do. And that\\'s what TikTok\\'s about really is you watch someone dance something, and then you dance it and then post it and wait for people to like it. And that sort of anxiety you get waiting for, \"Oh my gosh, how many likes did I get? How many dislikes did I get?\" And my kids were even joking around about it to each other or not joking around, but kind of competing, like \"I got 10 likes, I got 20 likes.\" And it\\'s a little disconcerting. It\\'s like, \"Guys, this isn\\'t reality. This is just stuff that\\'s happening online.\"\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThey try to look for validation.\\n\\nParent 4:\\n\\nYeah. And my son wants to be like this YouTuber, thinks he\\'s going to make tons of money. I\\'m like, \"No, you\\'re living in my basement if you think you\\'re going to be a YouTuber for the rest of your life.\" So it\\'s just like, I really feel like it doesn\\'t give them a sense of what\\'s real. And that\\'s scary.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nMy son tried to ask me if I would find a way to buy likes for him.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nOh my God. Is that a thing?\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nIs that a thing? I don\\'t know. But he was like ...\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYeah. He wanted me to buy likes for whatever he was doing so that he could as well be a famous YouTuber. I mean, I really just find that, I understand the whole feeling about like, what else can you give them to do? Because we do, we feel guilty. They\\'re sitting in this house, they have a disability. And my son is by himself. He has lots of brothers, but they\\'re not here. So it\\'s just really, really hard. But yeah, he wanted me to buy him likes. I don\\'t know how much it costs, but I wasn\\'t buying likes.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nDoes anyone else have any closing thoughts or we can wrap up and Administrator can take us through that. All right, Administrator?\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nCan you guys hear me?\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nYeah, we can hear you.\\n\\nAdministrator:\\n\\nAwesome. Awesome. Yeah. So thank you guys so much for your participation today and the information that you guys gave us. It\\'s just ... don\\'t do that. It\\'s just very consistent with the information that we got from other parents as well. So we really appreciate just all the information that you guys are giving us. We\\'re just collecting it to host a town hall meeting either like in late May, early June, where we\\'ll share the information, but also hopefully give tips on how to navigate internet usage with your children throughout the pandemic. So that\\'s why we\\'re running these groups. So once again, thank you guys so much.\\n\\n\\tIn regards to compensation. As soon as this is over, I\\'ll be sending your information to our administrator so that way she\\'s able to email you guys your $50 Amazon gift card. So today\\'s Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I would say by Thursday, if you don\\'t receive the gift card, please do not hesitate to either email me or give me a phone call and we will get that sorted out.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nAll right. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you so much for sharing today.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nThank you. And good luck, ladies.\\n\\nParent 6:\\n\\nYou too.\\n\\nParent 2:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nSpeaker 2:\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nParent 3:\\n\\nBye-bye.'\n"
